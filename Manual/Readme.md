The code for the manual Rmd is kept in the open, along with the output (pdf file). 

The bib. file is the zotero generated bibliography. It has to be in the open directory with the Rmd or else the Rmd has trouble finding it!

Manual figures simply contains figures that I want to put into the manual, which are static (not dynamically edited with each model run)
