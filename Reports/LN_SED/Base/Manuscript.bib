  abstract = {Depletion of calcium from forest soils has important implications for forest productivity and health. Ca is available to fine feeder roots from a number of soil organic and mineral sources, but identifying the primary source or changes of sources in response to environmental change is problematic. We used strontium isotope and alkaline earth element concentration ratios of trees and soils to discern the record of Ca sources for red spruce at a base-poor, acid deposition-impacted watershed. We measured 87Sr/86Sr and chemical compositions of cross-sectional stemwood cores of red spruce, other spruce tissues and sequential extracts of co-located soil samples. 87Sr/86Sr and Sr/Ba ratios together provide a tracer of alkaline earth element sources that distinguishes the plant-available fraction of the shallow organic soils from those of deeper organic and mineral soils. Ca/Sr ratios proved less diagnostic, due to within-tree processes that fractionate these elements from each other. Over the growth period from 1870 to 1960, 87Sr/86Sr and Sr/Ba ratios of stemwood samples became progressively more variable and on average trended toward values that considered together are characteristic of the uppermost forest floor. In detail the stemwood chemistry revealed an episode of simultaneous enhanced uptake of all alkaline earth elements during the growth period from 1930 to 1960, coincident with reported local and regional increases in atmospheric inputs of inorganic acidity. We attribute the temporal trends in stemwood chemistry to progressive shallowing of the effective depth of alkaline earth element uptake by fine roots over this growth period, due to preferential concentration of fine roots in the upper forest floor coupled with reduced nutrient uptake by roots in the lower organic and upper mineral soils in response to acid-induced aluminum toxicity. Although both increased atmospheric deposition and selective weathering of Ca-rich minerals such as apatite provide possible alternative explanations of aspects of the observed trends, the chemical buffering capacity of the forest floor-biomass pool limits their effectiveness as causal mechanisms.},

While the importance of this ``terrestrial Si filter'' is generally accepted, few data exist on the pools and fluxes of Si in forest vegetation and the rate of release of Si from decomposing plant tissues. We quantified the pools and fluxes of Si through vegetation and coarse woody debris (CWD) in a northern hardwood forest ecosystem (Watershed 6, W6) at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (HBEF) in New Hampshire, USA. Previous work suggested that the decomposition of CWD may have significantly contributed to an excess of DSi reported in stream-waters following experimental deforestation of Watershed 2 (W2) at the HBEF. We found that woody biomass (wood + bark) and foliage account for approximately 65\% and 31\%, respectively, of the total Si in biomass at the HBEF. During the decay of American beech (Fagus grandifolia) boles, Si loss tracked the whole-bole mass loss, while yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis) and sugar maple (Acer saccharum) decomposition resulted in a preferential Si retention of up to 30\% after 16 yr. A power-law model for the changes in wood and bark Si concentrations during decomposition, in combination with an exponential model for whole-bole mass loss, successfully reproduced Si dynamics in decaying boles. Our data suggest that a minimum of 50\% of the DSi annually produced in the soil of a biogeochemical reference watershed (W6) derives from biogenic Si (BSi) dissolution. The major source is fresh litter, whereas only 2\% comes from the decay of CWD. Decay of tree boles could only account for 9\% of the excess DSi release observed following the experimental deforestation of W2. Therefore, elevated DSi concentrations after forest disturbance are largely derived from other sources (e.g., dissolution of BSi from forest floor soils and/or mineral weathering).},

We examined losses of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and base cations across a four-million-year substrate age gradient of Hawaiian montane tropical forests, with the goal of understanding how losses depend on changes in biotic demand, weathering, and atmospheric sources. We were particularly interested in whether losses of nutrients that are not subject to traditional mechanisms of biotic availability could influence ecosystem fertility and nutrient limitation over time. Over a three-year period we sampled nutrient outputs in soil solutions below the active plant\textendash soil system and small streams, gaseous N losses (NO, N2O, and N2), and pools and transformations of N in soils. Weathering was the major determinant of ecosystem losses of P, of base cations and Si, and of ecosystem acid\textendash base status. Sharp reductions in weathering inputs after 20 000 years of forest development caused dramatically lower outputs of P ({$\sim$}65\% reduction), Ca2+ ({$\sim$}99\%), and Si ({$\sim$}94\%), to rates that matched inputs from dilute sea-salt and dust aerosols. Internal production of organic acids, in combination with low weathering, caused highly acidic soil waters (pH {$<$} 5.0) with elevated Al (up to 300 {$\mu$}g/L) and Ca:Al ratios ({$<$}0.3) below values considered critical thresholds for many plant species. Long-term N and P interactions were more complex than predicted by the Walker and Syers model, with important influences of N and P loss pathways that were not subject to direct biotic availability. While losses of available forms of dissolved N and P, and N gases followed (as predicted) ecosystem nutrient availability, significant dissolved organic N (DON) and dissolved organic P (DOP) losses occurred independent of ecosystem N or P status. DON losses were not sufficient (relative to external inputs) to sustain N limitation beyond 20 000 years, while dissolved P losses remained large enough to maintain P limitation in older forests. Forests developed high N:P loss ratios over time ({$>$}300 on mass weight basis) due to efficient P recycling and unexpectedly high N throughputs (4\textendash 9 kg N{$\cdot$}ha-1{$\cdot$}yr-1) by either N fixation and/or N deposition.},

Therefore, the distribution and cycling of these nutrients can be closely related. However, the quantitative relationships between these elements in vegetation, as expressed by nutrient ratios (N:P and N:S), vary within trees and between biomes (Vitousek et al. 1988). Accumulation of organic matter and associated N and S in soil over long time periods can be strongly influenced by P dynamics (McGill and Christie 1983). Over shorter periods, stabilization and mineralization of organic N and P in soil are controlled by different factors; the control of organic S may be similar to N or P, depending on its chemical form (McGill and Cole 1981).},

  abstract = {Nitrogen (N) is a key nutrient that shapes cycles of other essential elements in forests, including calcium (Ca). When N availability exceeds ecosystem demands, excess N can stimulate Ca leaching and deplete Ca from soils. Over the long term, these processes may alter the proportion of available Ca that is derived from atmospheric deposition vs. bedrock weathering, which has fundamental consequences for ecosystem properties and nutrient supply. We evaluated how landscape variation in soil N, reflecting long-term legacies of biological N fixation, influenced plant and soil Ca availability and ecosystem Ca sources across 22 temperate forests in Oregon. We also examined interactions between soil N and bedrock Ca using soil N gradients on contrasting basaltic vs. sedimentary bedrock that differed 17-fold in underlying Ca content. We found that low-N forests on Ca-rich basaltic bedrock relied strongly on Ca from weathering, but that soil N enrichment depleted readily weatherable mineral Ca and shifted forest reliance toward atmospheric Ca. Forests on Ca-poor sedimentary bedrock relied more consistently on atmospheric Ca across all levels of soil N enrichment. The broad importance of atmospheric Ca was unexpected given active regional uplift and erosion that are thought to rejuvenate weathering supply of soil minerals. Despite different Ca sources to forests on basaltic vs. sedimentary bedrock, we observed consistent declines in plant and soil Ca availability with increasing N, regardless of the Ca content of underlying bedrock. Thus, traditional measures of Ca availability in foliage and soil exchangeable pools may poorly reflect long-term Ca sources that sustain soil fertility. We conclude that long-term soil N enrichment can deplete available Ca and cause forests to rely increasingly on Ca from atmospheric deposition, which may limit ecosystem Ca supply in an increasingly N-rich world.},

Monthly E, however, showed strong positive linear correlations to monthly net radiation (R2=0.94), air temperature (R2=0.77), and daytime vapour pressure deficit (R2=0.76). During July\textendash September, monthly E (mm) was linearly correlated to monthly mean soil water content (\texttheta, m3m-3) in the 0\textendash 60cm layer (E=453\texttheta -21, R2=0.69), and GPP was similarly affected. Annual E and GPP of DF49 for the period 1998\textendash 2007 varied from 370 to 430mm and from 1950 to 2390gCm-2, respectively. After clearcut harvesting, E dropped to about 70\% of that for DF49 while ecosystem evapotranspiration was fully recovered when stand age was {$\sim$}12 years. This contrasted to GPP, which varied hyperbolically with stand age. Monthly GPP showed a strong positive linear relationship with E irrespective of the stand age. While annual WUE of HDF00 and HDF88 varied with age from 0.5 to 4.1gCm-2kg-1 and from 2.8 to 4.4gCm-2kg-1, respectively, it was quite conservative at {$\sim$}5.3gCm-2kg-1 for DF49. N-fertilization had little first-year response on E and WUE. This study not only provides important results for a more detailed validation of process-based models but also helps in predicting the influences of climate change and forest management on water vapour and CO2 fluxes in Douglas-fir forests.},

  abstract = {Nutrient transport from forest ecosystems is strongly regulated by the availability of anions in soil solution. Each of the major anions in forest soil solutions has some unique properties which affect its production and mobility. The production of bicarbonate, one of the most common anions, is regulated by soil CO2 pressure and pH. The mobility of phosphate is most strongly affected by adsorption reactions. The mobility of nitrate is regulated almost solely by biological processes, whereas chloride is relatively uninvolved in either biological or inorganic chemical reactions. Sulfate is intermediate, being involved in both biological and inorganic chemical reactions. Knowing these properties of the major anions, it is possible to assess and to predict the effects of several diverse site manipulations on soil leaching rates. Case studies from a site in Washington State consistently demonstrate the importance of accounting for bicarbonate transformations following site manipulations. Although organic anions are frequently dominant in cold-region soil solutions, very little information on the complex factors affecting their mobilities is available. Further research into organic anion mobility and futher attention to bicarbonate mobility should add greatly to the body of knowledge on nutrient transport processes in forest soils.},

Inorganically driven processes such as weathering, cation exchange, and soil leaching are often considerably more important in base cation cycles than in the cycles of N, P, and S, whereas organic processes such as heterotrophic immobilization and oxidation are typically less important (Figure 8.1). The fact that Ca, K, and Mg exist primarily as cations in solution whereas N, P, and S exist primarily as anions has major implications for the cycling of these nutrients and the effects of acid deposition upon these cycles. The introduction of H+, whether by atmospheric deposition or by internal processes, will directly impact the fluxes of Ca, K, and Mg via cation exchange or weathering processes. Thus, soil leaching is often of major importance in cation cycles, and many forest ecosystems show a net loss of base cations (in contrast to net gains of N and P; Cole and Rapp 1981).},

The unsaturated transient flow method has been developed for determining adsorption isotherms for weakly reactive ions without causing excessive desorption of strongly adsorbed native ions. The objective of this study was to extend the method to determine NO3 - adsorption isotherms in an Andisol in the absence or presence of Cl competing for the adsorption sites Kannondai subsoil (Hydric Hapludand), premixed with a Ca(NO3)2 or CaCl2-Ca(NO3)2 solution at different concentrations, was packed into sectionable columns, and one-dimensional water absorption experiments were conducted. Anion adsorption by soil, Q n, and the liquid-phase concentration, C n, prior to the water imbibition were obtained from the plots of the anion content vs. water content in the region beyond the `plane of separation,' where the antecedent solution was accumulated. The values of Qn and C n found in a series of column experiments were then used to construct the isotherms describing the solution composition-dependent adsorption of NO3 - and Cl-. e fitted to Langmuir-type equations, the maximum adsorption for NO3 - (Qmax= 27,1-29.0 mmolc kg-1) was consistently smaller than that for Cl- (Qmax = 455 46.1 mmolc kg-1), while the empirical constant K (= 0.0238 - 0.0274 m3 molc -1) was insensitive to the anion species. The anion content profiles predicted by the inferred adsorption isotherms closely agreed with the measured content profiles.},

  abstract = {Litterfall and its subsequent decomposition are important feedback mechanisms in the intrasystem cycling of nutrients in forest ecosystems. The amount of litterfall and the rate of decomposition are expected to vary with stand age and climate. Over a 2-year period, decomposition of five litter types were measured in two second-growth forest stands and one old-growth stand in the Cascade Mountains of southern Washington state, USA. Both second-growth stands were dominated by Douglas-fir [Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.,) Franco] but one had a significant proportion of red alder (Alnus rubra Bong.), a nitrogen (N) fixer. The old-growth stand was dominated by Douglas-fir and western hemlock [Tsuga heterophylla (Raf.) Sarg.]. All stands had a relatively shallow layer of forest floor mass. The five litter types were placed in each stand to evaluate decomposition patterns. Despite significant differences in stand age, microclimate and mean residence times for carbon (C) and N, the rates of litter mass loss varied only slightly between sites. The relative order of species litter mass loss was: vine maple {$>$} salal = western hemlock {$>$} Douglas-fir (from the youngest stand) {$>$} Douglas-fir (from the N rich stand with red alder). The initial litter lignin concentration, not lignin: N, was the primary determinant of decomposition rates, although the initial N concentration was the predictor for mass loss after 2 years in the N rich Douglasfir-alder stand. All litter types showed immobilization of N for nearly 2 years. Data for Douglas-fir litter suggest that higher levels of N may retard decomposition of tissues with greater amounts of lignified material. The retention of N by the litter appeared influenced by the nutrient capital of the stands as well as the forest floor C: N ratio. Decomposition was minimal during the cold winter months, but displayed a definitive peak period during early Fall with wet weather, warm soils, and fungal activity. Thus, longterm climatic change effects on forest floor C storage may depend more on changes in seasonally of precipitation changes than just temperature changes.},

  abstract = {The pace and degree of nutrient limitation are among the most critical uncertainties in predicting terrestrial ecosystem responses to global change. In the northeastern United States, forest growth has recently declined along with decreased soil calcium (Ca) availability, suggesting that acid rain has depleted soil Ca to the point where it may be a limiting nutrient. However, it is unknown whether the past 60 y of changes in Ca availability are strictly anthropogenic or partly a natural consequence of long-term ecosystem development. Here, we report a high-resolution millennial-scale record of Ca and 16 other elements from the sediments of Mirror Lake, a 15-ha lake in the White Mountains of New Hampshire surrounded by northern hardwood forest. We found that sedimentary Ca concentrations had been declining steadily for 900 y before regional Euro-American settlement. This Ca decline was not a result of serial episodic disturbances but instead the gradual weathering of soils and soil Ca availability. As Ca availability was declining, nitrogen availability concurrently was increasing. These data indicate that nutrient availability on base-poor, parent materials is sensitive to acidifying processes on millennial timescales. Forest harvesting and acid rain in the postsettlement period mobilized significant amounts of Ca from watershed soils, but these effects were exacerbated by the long-term pattern. Shifting nutrient limitation can potentially occur within 10,000 y of ecosystem development, which alters our assessments of the speed and trajectory of nutrient limitation in forests, and could require reformulation of global models of forest productivity.},

However, poor understanding of the mechanisms responsible hinders the development of effective land management strategies to enhance soil carbon storage. Here we empirically test the link between microbial ecophysiological traits and topsoil carbon content across geographically distributed soils and land use contrasts. We discovered distinct pH controls on microbial mechanisms of carbon accumulation. Land use intensification in low-pH soils that increased the pH above a threshold (\textasciitilde 6.2) leads to carbon loss through increased decomposition, following alleviation of acid retardation of microbial growth. However, loss of carbon with intensification in near-neutral pH soils was linked to decreased microbial biomass and reduced growth efficiency that was, in turn, related to trade-offs with stress alleviation and resource acquisition. Thus, less-intensive management practices in near-neutral pH soils have more potential for carbon storage through increased microbial growth efficiency, whereas in acidic soils, microbial growth is a bigger constraint on decomposition rates.},

Net N mineralization was unrelated to soil C:N, soil texture, precipitation, and temperature differences among sites. Net nitrification was negatively related to soil pH, and accounted for {$<$}20\% of net N mineralization at low-N sites, increasing to 85\textendash 100\% of net N mineralization at intermediate- and high-N sites. The ratio of net : gross N mineralization and nitrification increased along the gradient, indicating progressive saturation of microbial N demands at high soil N. Aboveground N uptake by plants increased asymptotically with net N mineralization to a peak of {$\sim$}35 kg N{$\cdot$}ha-1{$\cdot$}yr-1. Aboveground net primary production per unit net N mineralization varied inversely with soil N, suggesting progressive saturation of plant N demands at high soil N. Hydrologic N losses were dominated by dissolved organic N at low-N sites, with increased nitrate loss causing a shift to dominance by nitrate at high-N sites, particularly where net nitrification exceeded plant N demands. With the exception of N mineralization patterns, our results broadly support the application of the N-saturation model developed from studies of anthropogenic N deposition to understand N cycling and saturation of plant and microbial sinks along natural soil N gradients. This convergence of behavior in unpolluted and polluted forest N cycles suggests that where future reductions in deposition to polluted sites do occur, symptoms of N saturation are most likely to persist where soil N content remains elevated.},

Soil typeswere mapped in relation to the texture of the upper horizons and the depth ofoccurrence of the loamy saprolite. The position of mature individuals of fourcommon species, differing by they rooting depth, was identified and tree leaveswere analysed for major nutrients and strontium (Sr) isotopic ratios.On average, the range of leaf isotopic ratio (87Sr/86Sr= 0.714\textendash 0.716) was narrow compared to that of bulk soils(87Sr/86Sr = 0.72\textendash 0.77). Steep gradients ofincreasing 87Sr/86Sr in roots with soil depth were foundin all investigated profiles, which indicated that the flux of Sr deposited inrain and leached from the litter layer was tightly retained in the upper soillayers. Over the whole of the site, as well as within each soil unit, tree87Sr/86Sr ratios were very similar whatever the species,and close to litter and near-surface roots 87Sr/86Srratios, suggesting no or very little Sr contribution from deep tree roots.Variations of Ca and Sr concentrations in leaves were strongly correlated butnot with leaf 87Sr/86Sr ratios. These results support thetheory that Sr and Ca uptake and cycling are mostly superficial in tropicalrainforests.},

  abstract = {Maintaining, and if possible increasing, soil fertility is a major goal for sustainable forest management, because it determines to a large extent the site's capacity for wood production. As, generally, forest soils are poor, and the demand for wood is still increasing, the boundary of resilience of each ecosystem must be known. Several cases must be identified: the case of natural or native species forests, either planted or not, which are extensively managed and the case of intensively managed plantations. In this paper, input\textendash output budgets are calculated according to temporal and spatial scales. The measurement of the main inputs and outputs is discussed. When all the fluxes entering and leaving the selected compartment are measured, the budget provides a realistic picture of the direction of change in soil fertility. In other cases, the validity of the budget has to be considered according to the proposed hypothesis. A balanced budget means that the element considered is not depleted from the soil. This does not mean that no changes occur in the ecosystem. A positive budget means that the element considered is accumulating in the system, which is not always favorable. A negative budget means the element considered is depleted in the system, but it has to be related to the available soil reserves and to the rate of flux into available pool to be a real index of risk for the ecosystem. Information from several case studies shows the interest of these budgets because (i) they are able to characterize depletion before the direct analysis of the system would be able to indicate it, and (ii) they give useful quantitative data for recommendations applicable to forest management. These budgets have the disadvantage of being labor-intensive and expensive. They are also site-specific and give little direct information for identifying the mechanisms of nutrient tranformations within the ecosystem. The relationships between forest production and nutrient availability are not sufficiently known to be able to quantify the variation in production when nutrient depletion is observed. On account of the difficulty in calculating such a budget, the most efficient strategy could be the following: (i) calculate budgets in a representative network of sites; (ii) relate the individual budgets to more easily available parameters; and (iii) propose more simple indicators for managers. Land classification and the potential impact of forest management is required for giving appropriate recommendations to managers.},

Interest in such cation distribution problems has been motivated by a need to improve fertilization to maintain well-balanced concentrations of soil exchangeable Ca, Mg, and K for optimum crop growth; to control potentially toxic Al with Ca and Mg additions in acidic agronomic soils; and to control excess Na with Ca amendments in irrigated soils. The effects of atmospheric deposition of pollutant sulfate on soils is a similar problem and should alter cation distributions between solutions and exchange sites in predictable ways. The consequences of sulfate deposition are potentially serious: displacement of greater concentrations of exchangeable Al, Ca, and Mg (polyvalent cations) into soil solutions, and long-term depletions of exchangeable nutrient cations, for example, Ca and Mg, in highly weathered soils with limited mineral weathering rates.},

  abstract = {The ability of soil to sustain its supply of nutrients to a growing forest is controlled by a complex of biogeochemical processes. Forest soil data are notably absent, however, that describe sustained nutrient supply of nutrient depletion. The objective of this study was to evaluate how exchangeable nutrient cations of a previously cultivated Ultisol responded to the first three decades of pine forest development. On six occasions during the three decades, the upper 0.6 m of soil was sampled from eight permanent plots and chemically analyzed with the same procedures. During this period, KCl-exchangeable acidity (as positive charges of adsorbed H and Al ions) increased by 37.3 kmol"c/ha in the upper 0.6 m of soil and positive charges of exchangeable Ca and Mg were depleted by 34.8 and 8.9 kmol"c/ha (by 696 and 108 kg/ha), whereas, exchangeable K was reduced by only 0.5 kmol"c/ha (19 kg/ha). Depletion of soil exchangeable Ca was on the same order of magnitude as Ca removals (i.e., Ca accumulation in biomass and forest floor plus that lost in soil leaching). Removals of soil Mg also appeared to outpace resupply from recycling, atmospheric deposition, and mineral weathering, but not the same degree as Ca. Over the three decades, soil leaching loss of these divalent cations (from 0.6 m depth) appeared equal to cation accumulation in biomass plus forest floor, with sulfate balancing about half these cations in leachates. In contrast to Ca and Mg, total K removals from the soil exceeded reductions in soil exchangeable K by nearly 20-fold. Exchangeable K was well buffered in surface mineral soils apparently due to a combination of biological recycling via leaching of canopies and forest floor plus mineral weathering release. These nutrient dynamics may be common to many nutrient-demanding forest ecosystems supported by soils with low activity kandic or oxic horizons. Such soils (Ultisols and Oxisols) occur on many hundreds of millions of hectares in temperate and tropical zones.},

N appeared to be accumulating in the ecosystem. An annual decrease of \textasciitilde{} 2.8 kg/ha in vegetation was offset by estimated increases of 5.0 kg/ha in fallen logs, and 2.8 kg/ha in soil organic matter. Microparticulate litterfall provided a large input of N to the forest floor (3.3 kg@?ha\^-\^1@?yr\^-\^1). Annual input of metallic cations in precipitation was only 545 eq/ha, whereas weathering input (net release of cations to solution from primary and secondary minerals) was estimated by difference at @?9000 eq/ha. Total annual loss to groundwater was 9400 eq/ha and, because of little cation accumulation, loss almost exactly balanced input. Net transfers of P were small. Total annual input was 0.5 kg/ha, total loss was 0.7 kg/ha, and net accumulation was -0.2 kg/ha. Input of elements in precipitation and dryfall was small compared with that in the eastern United States. Water chemistry profiles showed that the biologically important elements N, P, and K increased in concentration as water passed through the canopy and litter layer but decreased as water passed through the rooted part of the mineral soil. In contrast, Na increased by a factor of 20 as water passed through the rooted soil. Concentrations of all elements except Mg were lower in the stream water than in solution at 2.0-m depth in the subsoil.

Titratable alkalinity dominated anion chemistry in the mineral soil, but in the upper parts of the water chemistry profile (precipitation, throughfall, and litter leachate) Cl\^- and SO"4\^= together accounted for 30-40\% of the negative charge. Total return to the forest floor in litterfall was greater than that reported for other Douglas-fir stands mainly because of plentiful microparticulate forms and coarse woody debris. Leaf fall accounted for less than half of the total litterfall input of N to the forest floor. Element accumulations in coarse woody debris almost cancelled the negative net annual increments in the living vegetation compartments. Overall cycling patterns show that only the biologically limiting element, N, was tightly conserved. For other elements, losses nearly equaled or even exceeded inputs. Redistribution from old to new foliage was also more important for N, P, and K than for Ca, Mg, and Na. Solution transport processes were important for all elements and dominated the cycling patterns of biologically less important elements such as Ca and Na.

The data required for model application can be operationally determined on soil samples, making the model generally applicable and independent of any type of calibration. The model considers the contribution to the weathering rate from 12 groups of the most common primary and secondary minerals of soils, reacting in separate reactions with H+-ion, H2O, CO2 and organic acids expressed as dissolved organic carbon (DOC). The weathering rate sub-model couples the effects of dissolved Al and base cations on the reaction mechanisms. The model takes into account changes in soil temperature, different chemical conditions, the effect of vegetation interactions with the soil and N transformations. The kinetic coefficients and reaction orders are based on a complete re-evaluation of weathering data available in the literature, and additional kinetic data determined by the authors. Data from 23 different independent determinations of the field weathering rate from 15 sites in Scandinavia, Central Europe and North America were compiled and used to verify the model. The model is capable of estimating the release rate of base cations due to chemical weathering from information on soil mineralogy, texture and geochemical properties of the order of {$\pm$}20\% of the rate determined by independent methods. The results indicate that small amounts of dark minerals like epidote and hornblende, and the plagioclase content, largely determine the field weathering rate.},

Moreover, most sites were not originally selected with the intent of comparing patterns of ozone concentrations among a variety of forest stands that differ in climate, air quality, vegetation cover, and elevation. The Integrated Forest Study (IFS) is unusual in providing an array of sites with many of these contrasting characteristics.},

  abstract = {We developed a process-oriented model called NutsFor that simulates nutrient cycling of major cations (Ca, Mg, K, Al, NH4, Na) and anions (NO3, SO4, Cl) and the stable isotope tracers for each of the respective elements at the scale of an ecosystem (isotopic fractionation are not simulated). We tested the ability of NutsFor to reproduce major element and stable isotope tracer (26Mg and 44Ca) cycling with the data from 35-yr old beech stand in France. NutsFor correctly reproduced the measured trends in soil solution chemistry for most major elements. The high similarity between modeled and measured distribution of 26Mg and 44Ca tracers in the ecosystem provided a unique and robust way to evaluate the hypotheses grounding the model and study the efficiency of Mg and Ca cycling at this very nutrient-poor site.},

  abstract = {Characterizing the nutrient cycles at the Integrated Forest Study (IFS) study sites required estimates of both nutrient inputs and nutrient outputs. To determine nutrient outputs, estimates of soil water flux had to be coupled with nutrient concentrations in soil lysimeters. However, only a few IFS sites had direct measures of soil water flux (e.g., gaged watersheds at Coweeta and Turkey Lakes), and even in these instances, water flux measurements were not directly comparable with water flux below the lowest lysimeter location. Thus, our purpose was to provide water flux estimates corresponding to lysimeter locations for the IFS sites. We used the hydrologic simulation model, PROSPER (Goldstein et al. 1974), to estimate evapotranspiration and soil water flux for several IFS study sites. A modeling approach was used because it was impractical to measure soil water flux at each site. While other hydrologic models were available (e.g., BROOK; Federer and Nash 1978), we chose PROSPER because it had been applied successfully in both hardwood and conifer forests at Coweeta (Swift et al. 1975; Huff and Swank 1985) and performed well in regional evapotranspiration assessments (USDA 1980).},

  abstract = {Sources of variation in leaf area index (LAI; m2 of projected leaf area per m2 of ground area) and its seasonal dynamics are not well known in managed Douglas-fir stands, despite the importance of leaf area in forecasting forest growth, particularly in stands impacted by insects or disease. The influence of Swiss needle cast (SNC) on coastal Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii [Mirb] Franco) LAI and litterfall dynamics was quantified by destructively sampling 122 stems from 36 different permanent plots throughout north coastal Oregon, USA, and by monitoring litterfall for 3 years in 15 of these plots. LAI, total annual litterfall, and the seasonal distribution of foliage and fine woody litterfall were all influenced by stand structural attributes, physiographic features, and SNC severity. Mean LAI in this study was 5.44 {$\pm$} 2.16. The relatively low LAIs were attributed primarily to the effects of SNC on foliage retention, and secondarily to its direct measurement by hierarchical foliage sampling in contrast to indirect measurement by light interception or tree allometry. For a given stand structure and SNC severity, LAI was 36\% greater in the fall after current year foliage was fully developed and older aged classes had not yet senesced. Annual litterfall expressed as a proportion of LAI at the start of the growing season varied from 0.13 to 0.53 and declined with increasing initial LAI. SNC also shifted more of the annual foliage litterfall to earlier in the spring. Fine woody litterfall experienced a different seasonal shift as the peak occurred later in the year on sites with high SNC, but this only occurred on northerly aspects. Defoliation from the endemic SNC pathogen can drastically reduce LAI and change both total and seasonal foliage litterfall patterns.},

  abstract = {The ForNBM was applied to the Nashwaak Experimental Watershed Project in central New Brunswick, Canada. The data represented a mixed hardwood site and included information about nutrient leaching, foliage and wood biomass, leaf fall, and ancillary information required for model initialization. Ancillary information included forest cover type, stand density, forest floor depth, soil rooting depth, soil texture, soil substrate type, initial amounts of biomass and N, S, Ca, Mg, and K content in foliage, wood, and roots, and mineral soil nutrient contents in soil solution, on ion-exchange sites, and in the soil. The authors were able to calibrate the model with existing data. The model simulated observed monthly leaching reasonably well. The r2-values of model simulations compared with field observations of monthly leaching of NO3-\_N, NH4+\_N, Ca, Mg, and K were 0.78, 0.7, 0.78, 0.84, and 0.75, respectively. Modeled multi-year cumulative leaching of NO3-\_N, NH4+\_N, Ca, Mg, and K compared with actual values gave r2-values close to one for all cases considered. The results also showed that soil nutrient leaching had increased approximately five-fold for NO3-\_N, 80\% for NH4+\_N, 71\% for K, 20\% for Ca, and 14\% for Mg during the 3 years following a stem-only harvest operation applied watershed-wide. However, the model simulation showed that increased nutrient leaching during the 11 years following the stem-only harvest was small compared with the amounts removed in the biomass during the harvest. Increased nutrient leaching following harvesting did not appear to impact site productivity over the long term.},
