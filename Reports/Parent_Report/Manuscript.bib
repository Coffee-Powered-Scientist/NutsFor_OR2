  abstract = {A generalized, lumped-parameter model of carbon (C), water, and nitrogen (N) interactions in forest ecosystems (PnET-CN) is presented. The model operates at a monthly time step and at the stand-to-watershed scale, and is validated against data on annual net primary productivity, monthly carbon and water balances, annual net N mineralization, nitrification, foliar N concentration and annual and monthly N leaching losses for two sites, Hubbard Brook (West Thornton, NH) and Harvard Forest (Petersham, MA). It is then used to predict transient responses in function resulting from changes in land use and N deposition, as well as the maximum rate of N cycling which can be sustained for any given combination of site, climate and species. Model predictions suggest a very long legacy effect of land use history on N cycling. Even with only one `active' soil organic matter pool, complete recovery from three modest harvests at Hubbard Brook is predicted to require more than two centuries at current N deposition rates. Complete recovery is predicted to take even longer at the Harvard Forest where biomass removals have been more intense. PnET-CN is used to predict maximum sustainable rates of N cycling for 14 sites throughout the northeastern USA. Predicted maximum values were higher, as expected, than measured N mineralization rates for all but one site. The measured fraction of N mineralization nitrified at these 14 sites showed a general relationship with the ratio of measured to maximum net N mineralization. This latter ratio is discussed as a potentially useful indicator of the degree of nitrogen saturation in forest ecosystems. A regional map of predicted maximum N cycling rates is presented based on regressions between model predictions and summary climatic variables.},

  abstract = {Increasing attention is being paid to using modern fuelwood as a substitute for fossil energies to reduce CO2 emissions. In this context, forest biomass, particularly harvesting residues (branches), and stumps and associated coarse roots, can be used to supply fuelwood chains. However, collecting harvesting residues can affect soil properties and trees, and these effects are still not fully understood. The main objective of the present study was to compile published data worldwide and to quantify the overall effects of removing harvesting residues on nutrient outputs, chemical and biological soil fertility and tree growth, through a meta-analysis. Our study showed that, compared with conventional stem-only harvest, removing the stem plus the harvesting residues generally increases nutrient outputs thereby leading to reduced amounts of total and available nutrients in soils and soil acidification, particularly when foliage is harvested along with the branches. Losses of available nutrients in soils could also be explained by reduced microbial activity and mineralization fluxes, which in turn, may be affected by changes in organic matter quality and environmental conditions (soil compaction, temperature and moisture). Soil fertility losses were shown to have consequences for the subsequent forest ecosystem: tree growth was reduced by 3\textendash 7\% in the short or medium term (up to 33years after harvest) in the most intensive harvests (e.g. when branches are exported with foliage). Combining all the results showed that, overall, whole-tree harvesting has negative impacts on soil properties and trees that may have an impact on the functioning of forest ecosystems. Practical measures that could be taken to mitigate the environmental consequences of removing harvesting residues are discussed.},

The plant system is defined by its nitrogen productivity, which allows calculations of the maximum amount of nitrogen that can be held in, and the maximum nitrogen flux density that can be utilized by, the plant subsystem. The most important response of the soil subsystem is a change in the microbial nitrogen concentration, from which the nitrogen absorption capacity can be derived. It is shown that of the two subsystems the soil must always saturate first. The time to reach saturation depends strongly on site history in terms of the sources of litter forming the soil organic matter and on the ratio between the external nitrogen inflows and the litter nitrogen flow.},

  abstract = {Sustainable forest production requires an understanding of the effects of site disturbance on tree growth and the consequences of soil amelioration and vegetation control practices. We assessed the impacts of biomass removals at harvest, soil compaction and tillage, and vegetation control on early growth of Douglas-fir in coastal Washington. Harvest treatments included removal of commercial bole only (BO), bole only up to 5-cm top diameter (BO5), total tree (TT), and total tree plus all legacy coarse woody debris (TTP). Vegetation control (VC) effects were tested in BO, while soil compaction (BO/SC) and compaction plus tillage (BO/SCT) were imposed in BO/VC. Five years after planting, biomass removal and soil compaction/tillage effects on tree growth were relatively small. At year 5, mean stem basal diameter in BO was greater than in TT, whereas mean height was similar in BO and BO/SC, but increased in BO/SCT. Control of competing vegetation markedly increased tree growth. At year 5, mean tree stem diameter at 1.3-m height (dbh) and height in BO/no vegetation control (NVC) were 34 mm and 308 cm, respectively, compared to 45 mm and 357 cm in BO/VC (P \&lt;0.01). Mean relative growth rate in stem diameter for trees in BO/VC was greater than in BO/NVC in years 2\textendash 4, but this trend reversed in year 5, suggesting that tree intraspecific competition may be greater in BO/VC than in BO/NVC. Vegetation control also increased second-flushing (i.e., the flushing of set buds in late summer) in years 4 and 5. Vegetation competition effects on tree growth appeared to be related to changes in available soil water rather than to competition for nutrients.},

  abstract = {Cascade Head is one of three prominent Middle to Late Eocene volcanic centers in the Oregon Coast Range that erupted alkalic basalt. At Cascade Head, 300\textendash 600 m of submarine to subaerial volcanic rocks are interbedded with thin-bedded, tuffaceous, brackish-water marine siltstone of the Nestucca Formation. The intercalated basalts in the Nestucca Formation are informally named Yachats Basalt of Cascade Head. This volcanic sequence consists of basal submarine basaltic breccia and lapilli tuff, ankaramitic basalt, aphyric submarine to subaerial alkali basalt lavas (which account for 75\% of the volcanic pile), hornblende trachyandesite lavas and dikes, and an uppermost basaltic sandstone unit. The Nestucca Formation also contains andesitic and more silicic ash deposits. Major- and trace-element trends and mass-balance modeling of the Cascade Head lavas are compatible with fractional crystallization of the observed phenocryst phases: olivine, clinopyroxene, plagioclase + apatite {$\pm$} ilmenite. The suite is characterized by enrichments in high field strength elements (HFSE) and by steeply negatively sloping rare earth element (REE) patterns ((La/Lu) n = 15\textendash 20). Transition metal contents are low (Ni, 5\textendash 36 ppm; Cr, 3\textendash 87 ppm; Sc, 1\textendash 22 ppm), indicating that none of the lavas are primitive. Elemental abundance diagrams are typical of continental alkalic basalt in that they show K depletion, and Nb and Ta enrichment. Element abundance diagrams of interbedded andesitic ash are distinct from those of the basalts, are depleted in Nb, Ta, and Ti, and indicate an arc source. The geochemical signature of the Yachats Basalt of Cascade Head is consistent with a fore-arc tectonic setting that was undergoing extension during late Eocene time. The basalts may be related to nearby hot spot activity but they could also have erupted through a ``slab window'' formed during plate reorganization during a decrease in the rate of convergence between the Farallon and North American plates.},

In numerous forest ecosystems, despite very low plant-available pools, elevated forest productivities are sustained. We hypothesize that trees access nutrient sources in the soil that are currently unaccounted by conventional soil analysis methods. We carried out an isotopic dilution assay to quantify the plant-available pools of calcium, magnesium and potassium and trace the soil phases that support these pools in 143 individual soil samples covering 3 climatic zones and 5 different soil types. For 81\%, 87\% and 90\% of the soil samples (respectively for Ca, Mg and K), the plant-available pools measured by isotopic dilution were greater than the conventional exchangeable pool. This additional pool is most likely supported by secondary non-crystalline mineral phases in interaction with soil organic matter and represents in many cases (respectively 43\%, 27\% and 47\% of the soil samples) a substantial amount of plant-available nutrient cations (50\% greater than the conventional exchangeable pools) that is likely to play an essential role in the biogeochemical functioning of forest ecosystems, in particular when the resources of Ca, Mg and K are low.},

Mineralization of litter from plants characteristic of such soils (in particular Festuca silvatica and Abies pectinata) produces large amounts of nitric acid. This bacterial nitrification is responsible for the solubilization of Ca2+, Mg2+, and K+ and must be involved in the slow weathering of minerals by acidolysis and in the biogeochemical cycling of Ca2+, Mg2+, and K+ in these soils.

  abstract = {Nitrogen (N) has historically been considered the most important mineral nutrient affecting performance of saplings in transitional northern hardwood forest of eastern North America, but recent attention has focused on the role of exchangeable soil calcium. Relative limitation by these factors may be changing because of enrichment of soil N from atmospheric deposition, and concomitant depletion of soil calcium due to leaching by acidic precipitation. We conducted a fertilization experiment to determine the relative importance of calcium, other base cations, several forms of nitrogen, and aluminum toxicity for the growth of saplings in a forest in northeastern Connecticut, USA. Five broadleaved deciduous and one needle-leaved evergreen species were examined; two of the broadleaved species are most abundant on fertile soil patches, and the other four are most abundant on the more prevalent low-fertility soils. Fertilizer was applied over 3 years to naturally established plants growing across the fertility gradient, and likelihood methods were used to determine whether light-dependent growth rate was affected. Of the two species that occur most frequently on fertile soils, one species responded most strongly to calcium application, and the other to nitrate. Of the four species of poorer soils, one responded to both calcium and ammonium, and the other three showed little response to any soil factor. The results suggest that calcium and nitrogen are of equal importance in determining juvenile growth across the suite of canopy tree species in transitional northern hardwood forest. The strong response of species occurring most commonly on fertile soils is suggestive of fundamental niche differentiation mode of community organization. Ongoing processes of atmospheric nitrogen deposition and soil calcium depletion from acidic precipitation may change competitive relationships of the canopy tree community of northern hardwood forests.},

One site (Mt. Benson, Nanaimo, B.C.) was nitrogen (N)-deficient and had a low site index (expected Douglas-fir height of 24 m at 50 years). The other site (Skykomish, western Washington) was N-rich and had a site index of 45 m at 50 years. Soil N accretion on the red alder units was estimated at 65 (Mt. Benson) and 42 (Skykomish) kg ha-1 year-1 for 23 years to a soil depth of 50 cm. At the current stage of plantation development, presence of red alder at the infertile Mt. Benson site increased average Douglas-fir diameter but did not affect its basal area and basal area growth rate; including alder stem biomass increased total stand basal area and basal area growth 2.5 fold. Presence of red alder at the fertile Skykomish site decreased average diameter, basal area, and basal area growth of Douglas-fir; including alder biomass left total stand basal area and basal area growth unchanged. Douglas-fir foliar N concentrations on Mt. Benson increased from 0.93 without alder to 1.41\% on the red alder unit but were 1.55\% for both units at Skykomish. Although alder did not affect Douglas-fir aboveground biomass and net primary production on Mt. Benson, total ecosystem biomass doubled and production tripled when alder biomass was included. Conversely, at Skykomish, Douglas-fir biomass and production decreased, and total ecosystem values were essentially unchanged. Mixing red alder and Douglas-fir seems to have great potential for increasing Douglas-fir growth and ecosystem production on infertile, N-deficient sites but probably has limited value on fertile, N-rich sites.},

This depletion of calcium has been inferred from studies1,2,3 showing that sources of calcium in forest ecosystems\textemdash namely, atmospheric deposition and mineral weathering of silicate rocks such as plagioclase, a calcium-sodium silicate\textemdash do not match calcium outputs observed in forest streams. It is therefore thought that calcium is being lost from exchangeable and organically bound calcium in forest soils. Here we investigate the sources of calcium in the Hubbard Brook experimental forest, through analysis of calcium and strontium abundances and strontium isotope ratios within various soil, vegetation and hydrological pools. We show that the dissolution of apatite (calcium phosphate) represents a source of calcium that is comparable in size to known inputs from atmospheric sources and silicate weathering. Moreover, apatite-derived calcium was utilized largely by ectomycorrhizal tree species, suggesting that mycorrhizae may weather apatite and absorb the released ions directly, without the ions entering the exchangeable soil pool. Therefore, it seems that apatite weathering can compensate for some of the calcium lost from base-poor ecosystems, and should be considered when estimating soil acidification impacts and calcium cycling.},

Sarg.-Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirbel) Franco] ecosystems on chronosequence of five uplifted marine terraces in coastal Oregon. The terraces occur 0.25 to 8.6 km from the Pacific Ocean and range from 80 to {$\sim$}500 kyr in age. The soils are highly weathered and include Inceptisols on the youngest terrace and Spodosols with clay-enriched horizons and Ultisols on the older terraces. Bulk precipitation, throughfall, and soil solutions (four depths) were collected monthly from November 1992 through April 1993. The solutions were analyzed for pH, dissolved cations (Na, Mg, Ca, K, Fe, Al, and Si), anions (Cl, SO4, HCO3, NO3, and PO4), and organic C. Cations (\textmu molc L-1) in all solutions were ranked: Na {$>$} Mg {$>$} Ca {$\geq$} K {$>$} H; anions were ranked: Cl {$>$} SO4 {$>$} NO3 {$>>$} HCO3. The Na/Cl ratio in all solutions was comparable to that of seawater. The mean sums of cations and anions in all solutions declined sharply with distance from the coast. Throughfall enrichment of all ions suggests that aerosol impaction of sea salts is a dominant process within the coastal fogbelt of Oregon. In that the soils have low inherent fertility, the trees appear to obtain Ca, Mg, K, and S primarily from atmospheric sources. These nutrients are utilized by abundant fine roots in the forest floor and upper 5 to 20 cm of mineral soil. Net cation loss is less than in other areas of the Pacific Northwest and is controlled by organic anions rather than the bicarbonate anion.},

  abstract = {Nutrient-poor soils often support low-stature grasslands, savannas and shrublands where the climate is warm enough and wet enough for closed forests. Though this pattern has long been recognised, the causes are debated and poorly explored. I tested the hypothesis that forest fails to develop where the total nutrient pool is too small to construct both the foliage and the wood. I estimated potential woody biomass from the difference between soil nutrient stocks and forest foliage stocks. Nutrient stocks required for foliage were estimated from leaf tissue concentrations and foliage biomass typical of Amazon forests. Potential wood biomass was estimated from wood nutrient concentrations typical of Amazon forests. Data on soil nutrient stocks were assembled from studies from South American and African forests and savannas and from south-western Australian and south-west African heathlands. According to these calculations, estimated nutrient stocks (kg ha-1) to build a forest would need to be {$>$} = P: 20\textendash 30, K 200\textendash 350, Ca 300\textendash 600 and Mg 55\textendash 65. Many surface soil horizons from both savanna and heathland sites were below these thresholds. However when deeper soil layers were included, most soils had adequate nutrient stocks. The nutrients in shortest supply were Ca and K and not P. This study suggests that nutrient stocks are usually adequate for constructing the wood needed to build a forest, except where soils are highly leached and very shallow. The implication is that, at steady state, low nutrient stocks seldom constrain forest development. The apparent failure of low nutrient stocks to explain the missing forests on nutrient-poor soils emphasises the need for new ideas on how nutrients, alone or in combination with other factors such as fire, influence vegetation structure.},

  abstract = {In soils, mycorrhiza (microscopic fungal hypha) living in symbiosis with plant roots are the biological interface by which plants obtain, from rocks and organic matter, the nutrients necessary for their growth and maintenance. Despite their central role in soils, the mechanism and kinetics of mineral alteration by mycorrhiza are poorly constrained quantitatively. Here, we report in situ quantification of weathering rates from a mineral substrate, (001) basal plane of biotite, by a surface-bound hypha of Paxillus involutus, grown in association with the root system of a Scots pine, Pinus sylvestris. Four thin-sections were extracted by focused ion beam (FIB) milling along a single hypha grown over the biotite surface. Depth-profile of Si, O, K, Mg, Fe and Al concentrations were performed at the hypha\textendash biotite interface by scanning transmission electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (STEM-EDX). Large removals of K (50\textendash 65\%), Mg (55\textendash 75\%), Fe (80\textendash 85\%) and Al (75\textendash 85\%) were observed in the topmost 40nm of biotite underneath the hypha while Si and O are preserved throughout the depth-profile. A quantitative model of alteration at the hypha-scale was developed based on solid-state diffusion fluxes of elements into the hypha and the break-down/mineralogical re-arrangement of biotite. A strong acidification was also observed with hypha bound to the biotite surface reaching pH{$<$}4.6. When consistently compared with the abiotic biotite dissolution, we conclude that the surface-bound mycorrhiza accelerate the biotite alteration kinetics between pH 3.5 and 5.8 to {$\sim$}0.04{$\mu$}molbiotitem-2h-1. Our current work reaffirms that fungal mineral alteration is a process that combines our previously documented bio-mechanical forcing with the {$\mu$}m-scale acidification mediated by surface-bound hypha and a subsequent chemical element removal due to the fungal action. As such, our study presents a first kinetic framework for mycorrhizal alteration at the hypha-scale under close-to-natural experimental conditions.},

Cascade Head Experimental Forest, in the Coast Range, has higher net N mineralization and nitrification rates and soil pH is lower. Communities of putative bacterial [ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB)] and archaeal [ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA)] ammonia oxidizers were examined by targeting the gene amoA, which codes for subunit A of ammonia monooxygenase. Nitrification potential was significantly higher in red alder compared with Douglas-fir soil and greater at Cascade Head than H.J. Andrews. Ammonia-oxidizing bacteria amoA genes were amplified from all soils, but AOA amoA genes could only be amplified at Cascade Head. Gene copy numbers of AOB and AOA amoA were similar at Cascade Head regardless of tree type (2.3\textendash 6.0 \texttimes{} 106amoA gene copies g-1 of soil). DNA sequences of amoA revealed that AOB were members of Nitrosospira clusters 1, 2 and 4. Ammonia-oxidizing bacteria community composition, determined by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) profiles, varied among sites and between tree types. Many of the AOA amoA sequences clustered with environmental clones previously obtained from soil; however, several sequences were more similar to clones previously recovered from marine and estuarine sediments. As with AOB, the AOA community composition differed between red alder and Douglas-fir soils.},

  abstract = {Depletion of calcium from forest soils has important implications for forest productivity and health. Ca is available to fine feeder roots from a number of soil organic and mineral sources, but identifying the primary source or changes of sources in response to environmental change is problematic. We used strontium isotope and alkaline earth element concentration ratios of trees and soils to discern the record of Ca sources for red spruce at a base-poor, acid deposition-impacted watershed. We measured 87Sr/86Sr and chemical compositions of cross-sectional stemwood cores of red spruce, other spruce tissues and sequential extracts of co-located soil samples. 87Sr/86Sr and Sr/Ba ratios together provide a tracer of alkaline earth element sources that distinguishes the plant-available fraction of the shallow organic soils from those of deeper organic and mineral soils. Ca/Sr ratios proved less diagnostic, due to within-tree processes that fractionate these elements from each other. Over the growth period from 1870 to 1960, 87Sr/86Sr and Sr/Ba ratios of stemwood samples became progressively more variable and on average trended toward values that considered together are characteristic of the uppermost forest floor. In detail the stemwood chemistry revealed an episode of simultaneous enhanced uptake of all alkaline earth elements during the growth period from 1930 to 1960, coincident with reported local and regional increases in atmospheric inputs of inorganic acidity. We attribute the temporal trends in stemwood chemistry to progressive shallowing of the effective depth of alkaline earth element uptake by fine roots over this growth period, due to preferential concentration of fine roots in the upper forest floor coupled with reduced nutrient uptake by roots in the lower organic and upper mineral soils in response to acid-induced aluminum toxicity. Although both increased atmospheric deposition and selective weathering of Ca-rich minerals such as apatite provide possible alternative explanations of aspects of the observed trends, the chemical buffering capacity of the forest floor-biomass pool limits their effectiveness as causal mechanisms.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong class="journal-contentHeaderColor"{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} Accurate estimates of base cation weathering rates in forest soils are crucial for policy decisions on sustainable biomass harvest levels and for calculations of critical loads of acidity. The PROFILE model is one of the most frequently used methods to quantify weathering rates, where the quantitative mineralogical input has often been calculated by the A2M (``Analysis to Mineralogy'') program based solely on geochemical data. The aim of this study was to investigate how uncertainties in quantitative mineralogy, originating from modeled mineral abundance and assumed stoichiometry, influence PROFILE weathering estimate, by using measured quantitative mineralogy by X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) as a reference. Weathering rates were determined for two sites, one in northern (Flakaliden) and one in southern (Asa) Sweden. At each site, 3\textendash 4 soil profiles were analyzed at 10\&thinsp;cm depth intervals. Normative quantitative mineralogy was calculated from geochemical data and qualitative mineral data with the A2M program using two sets of qualitative mineralogical data inputs to A2M: (1) a site-specific mineralogy based on information about mineral identification and mineral chemical composition as determined directly by XRPD and electron microprobe analysis (EMPA), and (2) regional mineralogy, representing the assumed minerals present and assumed mineral chemical compositions for large geographical areas in Sweden, as per previous published studies. Arithmetic means of the weathering rates determined from A2M inputs (\emph{W}\textsubscript{A2M}) were generally in relatively close agreement with those (\emph{W}\textsubscript{XRPD}) determined by inputs based on direct XRPD and EMPA measurements. The hypothesis that using site-specific instead of regional mineralogy will improve the confidence in mineral data input to PROFILE was supported for Flakaliden. However, at Asa, site-specific mineralogies reduced the discrepancy for Na between \emph{W}\textsubscript{A2M} and \emph{W}\textsubscript{XRPD} but produced larger and significant discrepancies for K, Ca and Mg. For Ca and Mg the differences between weathering rates based on different mineralogies could be explained by differences in the content of some specific Ca- and Mg-bearing minerals, in particular amphibole, apatite, pyroxene and illite. Improving the accuracy in the determination of these minerals would reduce weathering uncertainties. High uncertainties in mineralogy, due for example to different A2M assumptions, had surprisingly little effect on the predicted weathering of Na- and K-bearing minerals. This can be explained by the fact that the weathering rate constants for the minerals involved, e.g. K feldspar and micas, are similar in PROFILE. Improving the description of the dissolution rate kinetics of the plagioclase mineral group as well as major K-bearing minerals (K feldspars and micas) should be a priority to help improve future weathering estimates with the PROFILE model.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Seasonal patterns are evident in surface water chemistry draining forested headwaters in the northeastern United States. This variation in surface water chemistry is largely driven by seasonal fluctuations in hydrologic flow paths and biological activity. Especially during spring snowmelt, high-flow conditions are characterized by high concentrations of NO3-, naturally occurring organic anions and aluminum species, and depression in surface water pH and acid neutralizing capacity (ANC). Under extreme conditions, decreases in pH and ANC and increases in aluminum can have adverse effects on aquatic biota. As a result, there is a critical need to be able to simulate seasonal variations in surface water acid-base chemistry. Previously, a single soil layer biogeochemical model (PnET-BGC) was found to be inadequate to simulate seasonal variations in stream chemistry draining acid-sensitive forest watersheds. In order to better simulate the seasonal variations in the acid-base chemistry of surface waters, a two-layer model (PnET-BGC2) was formulated and applied to a northern forest ecosystem. End-member mixing analysis was used to better understand hydrologic flow paths contributing to temporal patterns in stream chemistry and to parameterize the model. The resulting two-layer model is generally able to reproduce the seasonal variations in surface water runoff, concentrations of base cations, SO42-, NO3-, pH, and ANC.},

While the importance of this ``terrestrial Si filter'' is generally accepted, few data exist on the pools and fluxes of Si in forest vegetation and the rate of release of Si from decomposing plant tissues. We quantified the pools and fluxes of Si through vegetation and coarse woody debris (CWD) in a northern hardwood forest ecosystem (Watershed 6, W6) at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (HBEF) in New Hampshire, USA. Previous work suggested that the decomposition of CWD may have significantly contributed to an excess of DSi reported in stream-waters following experimental deforestation of Watershed 2 (W2) at the HBEF. We found that woody biomass (wood + bark) and foliage account for approximately 65\% and 31\%, respectively, of the total Si in biomass at the HBEF. During the decay of American beech (Fagus grandifolia) boles, Si loss tracked the whole-bole mass loss, while yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis) and sugar maple (Acer saccharum) decomposition resulted in a preferential Si retention of up to 30\% after 16 yr. A power-law model for the changes in wood and bark Si concentrations during decomposition, in combination with an exponential model for whole-bole mass loss, successfully reproduced Si dynamics in decaying boles. Our data suggest that a minimum of 50\% of the DSi annually produced in the soil of a biogeochemical reference watershed (W6) derives from biogenic Si (BSi) dissolution. The major source is fresh litter, whereas only 2\% comes from the decay of CWD. Decay of tree boles could only account for 9\% of the excess DSi release observed following the experimental deforestation of W2. Therefore, elevated DSi concentrations after forest disturbance are largely derived from other sources (e.g., dissolution of BSi from forest floor soils and/or mineral weathering).},

  abstract = {Carbon and nutrients in the forest floor and mineral soil were measured to determine amounts and variation among eighteen 0.081-ha plots in a Douglas-fir [Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco] plantation growing with volunteer red alder (Alnus rubra Bong.). Ten years earlier, the preceding mature conifer stand was clearcut and nearly all logging slash and forest floor were consumed by slash fire. Forest floor mass in the 9-yr-old plantation averaged 9.86 Mg ha\textendash 1, with 3.71 Mg C, 98.0 kg N, 10.6 kg P, and 8.4 kg S ha\textendash 1.

The 2- to {$<$}6-mm soil fraction averaged an additional 100 Mg C, 4480 kg N, and 1700 kg P ha\textendash 1. Net mineralizable N as NH4 (anaerobic N mineralization index) totaled 99 kg N ha\textendash 1 in the top 45 cm of the mineral soil and 62 kg N ha\textendash 1 in the 45- to 100-cm depth. Density fractionation showed that the light fraction ({$<$}1.65 Mg m \textendash 3 ) was only 13.4\% of the fine soil mass of the 0- to 15-cm depth, yet contained about 40\% of the total C and N capital in the {$<$}2-mm size fraction. The substantial amounts of C and nutrients in this low-bulk density soil ({$<$}2-mm fraction, 0.30 Mg m \textendash{} 3 ) indicate a fertile soil despite large previous losses of organic matter and N from the site.},

To account for discrepancies in ecosystem Ca budgets, it has been hypothesized that the highly insoluble biomineral Ca oxalate might represent an additional soil Ca pool that is not detected in standard measures of soil-exchangeable Ca. We asked whether several standard method extractants for soil-exchangeable Ca could also access Ca held in Ca oxalate crystals using spike recovery tests in both pure solutions and soil extractions. In solutions of the extractants ammonium chloride, ammonium acetate, and barium chloride, we observed 2\% to 104\% dissolution of Ca oxalate crystals, with dissolution increasing with both solution molarity and ionic potential of cation extractant.

The1J composed 59, 27, 6, 6, and 1\%, re\- spectively, of the total cubic volume (13,290 jr) in 1947. Gross volume growth averaged 94 jr per acre per year, and mor\- tality averaged 86 jr per acre per year. Net growth was therefore minimal, and total stand volume remained nearly constant for 36 years. Douglas-fir, which accounted for only one-third of the gross growth and nearly one-half of the mortality, is losing dominance to western hemlock, which pro\- vided nearly one-half the gross growth and only 28\% of the mortality. Pacific silver fir increased in importance in the lower canopy and composed 60\% of the in\- growth. Thus, although net gain in timber volume was nil, substantial changes oc\- curred in stand characteristics during the 1947-1983 period.},

We assessed changes in P availability over 10 years associated with harvest intensity (bole-only vs. whole-tree harvest) and vegetation control treatments (initial vegetation control (IVC) vs. five years of annual vegetation control (AVC)) using a P fractionation procedure. Fractions were characterized at 0\textendash 15, 15\textendash 30, and 30\textendash 60 cm soil depths in two coast Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco var. menziesii) plantations with strongly contrasting soil properties near Matlock, WA (young soils formed in glacial outwash) and Molalla, OR (relatively old soils formed in igneous residuum and exhibiting andic properties). Al and Fe concentrations associated with short-range order minerals were greater at Molalla than Matlock and generally decreased with depth at both sites. We observed decreases in most total-P and P-fraction concentrations across the three soil depths at the Molalla site. Effects were less pronounced and generally inconsistent at the Matlock site. Decreases in total P and P fraction concentrations were greatest in the AVC treatments at Matlock, but opposite trends were observed at Molalla where decreases were greatest with IVC. There was no difference between harvest treatments on the change in P fractions in most instances, with the exception of the 30\textendash 60 cm depth at Matlock where concentrations of some P fractions were maintained or increased with bole-only harvesting. Ten-year responses indicate harvest intensity has limited effects on long-term productivity associated with soil P because of the large size of the soil P pools and the relatively small changes in soil P that occurred with treatment. Decreases in P concentrations with AVC at Matlock and IVC at Molalla were larger than the other treatments and highlight the important role of vegetation in P dynamics following harvesting at these sites.},

To illuminate tradeoffs relevant to policymakers, forest sector stakeholders, and consumers of forest products, we utilize three Key Performance Indicators\&mdash;average carbon storage in the forest and wood products; cumulative timber output; and discounted cash flow\&mdash;to compare four alternative management scenarios for Douglas-fir forests on 64 parcels across western Oregon and Washington. These scenarios are designed to meet one of two alternative management objectives: (i) maximize Net Present Value; or (ii) maximize sustained timber yield; according to one of two alternative sets of forest practice constraints: (i) compliance with minimum Oregon/Washington Forest Practices Act (FPA) rules; or (ii) two key requirements (increased green tree retention and wider riparian buffers) of Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification. Improved performance in terms of carbon storage for these alternatives generally also corresponded with reduced Net Present Value and timber yields. The gap between FSC and FPA performance indicators was wider in Oregon than Washington, which is primarily attributed to the higher level of stream protection required under Washington versus Oregon FPA rules. We observed consistently higher average carbon storage per cumulative timber output among FSC scenarios relative to business-as-usual, indicating FSC-certified wood carries an embedded carbon benefit. Our findings highlight options for targeted policies to incentivize management that increases carbon storage and minimizes disruptions in timber output, as well as for narrowing the financial gap (or opportunity cost) that would be involved in a transition away from contemporary common practice on industrial timberlands in the coastal Douglas-fir forests of the Pacific Northwest.},

  abstract = {Calcium (Ca) is an important element for neutralizing soil acidity in temperate forests. The immediate availability of Ca in forested acid soils is largely dependent on mineralization of organic Ca, which may differ significantly among tree species. I estimated net Ca mineralization in the forest floor and upper 15cm of mineral soil beneath six tree species in a mixed-species forest in northwestern Connecticut, using the buried bag method. Net Ca mineralization in the forest floor was significantly correlated with mass loss of the decomposing forest floor litter. Higher mass loss fractions during the summer and in forest floors beneath sugar maple (Acer saccharum) and white ash (Fraxinus americana) coincided with higher net Ca mineralization rates. More Ca was released per unit mass loss of forest floor beneath sugar maple and white ash (362 and 390mmolkg-1, respectively) than beneath American beech (Fagus grandifolia), red maple (Acer rubrum), red oak (Quercus rubra) and hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) (183, 133, 147, and 190mmolkg-1, respectively). Due to the high forest floor mass beneath red maple, beech, red oak, and hemlock, net Ca mineralization in the forest floor per unit area beneath these tree species did not differ significantly from sugar maple and white ash (ranging between 80mmolm-2 per year for beech and 141mmolm-2 per year for sugar maple). Net Ca mineralization in the mineral soil was significantly larger beneath sugar maple (142mmolm-2 per year) than beneath the other tree species (ranging between -10mmolm-2 per year for beech and 55mmolm-2 per year for white ash). These results show that Ca mineralization rates are large and differ significantly among tree species, affecting the spatial pattern of soil acidity and Ca availability in a mixed-species forest stand.},

For Ca, net leaching loss is 4\textendash 16 kg/ha/yr in mature forests, and whole-tree harvest removes 200\textendash 1100 kg/ha. Such leaching loss and harvest removal could reduce total soil and biomass Ca by 20\%\textendash 60\% in only 120 years.

  abstract = {Elevated N deposition has occurred in the Los Angeles Basin in southern California for at least the last 40 years. Elevated streamwater NO3- fluxes and high nitric oxide (NO) fluxes from soil, indicators of N saturation, have recently been reported for chaparral watersheds exposed to chronic N deposition in the San Gabriel Mountains north/northeast of Los Angeles. A number of nutritional and edaphic parameters across a deposition gradient in the San Bernardino Mountains (SBM) support the hypothesis that the mixed conifer forest in the western end of the range is also N saturated. Concentrations of NO3- in the soil solution or in soil extracts during the summer months were 14 to 44 times higher at Camp Paivika (CP), a western high N deposition site, than at Camp Osceola (CAO) or Barton Flats (BF), eastern low-pollution sites. Accumulation of NO3- in foliage of bracken fern (Pteridium aquilinum var. pubescens Underw.) and overstory species was also much greater at CP than at CAO and a site near BF. Nitric oxide fluxes in mid-August from relatively dry soil at CP were ca. 20 times higher than for typical forests in North America. Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, on the other hand, were low in the SBM sites. However, emissions of NO and N2O were several-fold higher at CP than at BF, a relatively low-pollution site. High NO emissions from otherwise undisturbed and well-drained forest soils of the western US may prove useful as a diagnostic indicator of N saturation. Nitrogen mineralization was greater at CP and Dogwood (high-pollution sites) than at CAO and Heartbar (low-pollution sites). Additional indicators of N enrichment at CP compared with the low N deposition sites include: low C:N ratios in soil and foliage, high foliar N:P ratios, higher nitrification rates and high soil acidity. Lower pH and base saturation were observed in soil from two high-pollution sites compared with two low-pollution sites. In summary, high NO emissions and elevated NO3- concentrations in the soil solution and in foliage, and high foliar N:P ratios at CP, indicate N in excess of biotic demand, with potential above-normal loss of N from the ecosystem - and thus, a N-saturated condition. Model outputs from the nutrient cycling model (NuCM) agreed well with field data from the SBM on elevated soil solution NO3- concentrations, reduced soil base saturation, and lack of a growth response to increasing N deposition.},

The model was evaluated against soil and stream data at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, New Hampshire. Model predictions of concentrations and fluxes of major elements generally agreed reasonably well with measured values, as estimated by normalized mean error and normalized mean absolute error. Model output of soil base saturation and stream acid neutralizing capacity were sensitive to parameter values of soil partial pressure of carbon dioxide, soil mass, soil cation exchange capacity, and soil selectivity coefficients of calcium and aluminum. PnET-BGC can be used as a tool to evaluate the response of soil and water chemistry of forest ecosystems to disturbances such as clear-cutting, climatic events, and atmospheric deposition.},

The model routes precipitation through the forest canopy, soil horizons, streams and lakes using mass balance concepts and equations which relate flow to hydraulic gradients. The physical-chemical processes which change the acid-base characteristics of the water are simulated by rate (kinetic) and equilibrium expressions and include mass transfers between gas, liquid and solid phases. The aqueous constituents simulated include: pH, alkalinity, the major cations (Ca2+ Mg2+, K+, Na+, and NH4+) and anions (SOinf4sup2-, NOinf3sup-, Cl-, F-), monomeric Al and its inorganic and organic complexes, organic acid analogues and dissolved inorganic carbon (CT). Since free hydrogen ion (H+) (and hence pH) is not conserved, its concentration is derived from the solution alkalinity and the total concentrations of inorganic C, organic acid, and monomeric Al.},

The stage of alteration characterized by secondary mineral formation was distinctly microenvironment dependent. Smectite formed as the initial crystalline weathering product of basalts in the Oregon Coast Range, but was metastable with respect to hydrated halloysite along fracture zones in the weathering crust where more leaching micro-environments occureed. Smectite altered to chloritic intergrade and halloysite in cyclic wet and dry pedoenvironments. The occurrence of gibbsite was related to the alteration of glassy basalt lithologies under acid leaching conditions.

We core-sampled living roots, dead organic matter, and mineral fragments at three soil depths on a 300-sample grid at nine forested sites in western Washington and Oregon resulting in approximately 7200 samples. We explored relationships between materials across depths and at three scales\textemdash point, block and site\textemdash and examined the data to quantify the degree of spatial clustering. Mass of roots and organic matter declined with depth; there were no consistent patterns with depth for mineral fragments. Correlations between values at the same point but at different depths were low for roots and organic matter at all sites (mean r values {$<$} 0.3). Total soil carbon per site was negatively correlated (r = -0.85) with total root mass; correlations between other site or tree variables and below-ground materials were much lower (r = -0.21 to 0.34). There were no detectable spatial patterns in root mass. The number of samples needed to estimate mean root mass was calculated by site and for several desired precision levels; this power analysis will aid others working at similar sites in determining necessary sample sizes a priori, or conversely, in estimating level of precision given a particular sample size. Precision of {$\pm$} 1.5 kg m-3 could be achieved with less than 100 samples in the upper layer at most sites.},

We examined losses of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and base cations across a four-million-year substrate age gradient of Hawaiian montane tropical forests, with the goal of understanding how losses depend on changes in biotic demand, weathering, and atmospheric sources. We were particularly interested in whether losses of nutrients that are not subject to traditional mechanisms of biotic availability could influence ecosystem fertility and nutrient limitation over time. Over a three-year period we sampled nutrient outputs in soil solutions below the active plant\textendash soil system and small streams, gaseous N losses (NO, N2O, and N2), and pools and transformations of N in soils. Weathering was the major determinant of ecosystem losses of P, of base cations and Si, and of ecosystem acid\textendash base status. Sharp reductions in weathering inputs after 20 000 years of forest development caused dramatically lower outputs of P ({$\sim$}65\% reduction), Ca2+ ({$\sim$}99\%), and Si ({$\sim$}94\%), to rates that matched inputs from dilute sea-salt and dust aerosols. Internal production of organic acids, in combination with low weathering, caused highly acidic soil waters (pH {$<$} 5.0) with elevated Al (up to 300 {$\mu$}g/L) and Ca:Al ratios ({$<$}0.3) below values considered critical thresholds for many plant species. Long-term N and P interactions were more complex than predicted by the Walker and Syers model, with important influences of N and P loss pathways that were not subject to direct biotic availability. While losses of available forms of dissolved N and P, and N gases followed (as predicted) ecosystem nutrient availability, significant dissolved organic N (DON) and dissolved organic P (DOP) losses occurred independent of ecosystem N or P status. DON losses were not sufficient (relative to external inputs) to sustain N limitation beyond 20 000 years, while dissolved P losses remained large enough to maintain P limitation in older forests. Forests developed high N:P loss ratios over time ({$>$}300 on mass weight basis) due to efficient P recycling and unexpectedly high N throughputs (4\textendash 9 kg N{$\cdot$}ha-1{$\cdot$}yr-1) by either N fixation and/or N deposition.},

Further, such silviculture is compatible with the production of desired amenities. Vigorous implementation of such practices wherever Douglas-fir is cultivated will increase the world's timber resources, and be an effective strategy for reducing the pressure, occasioned by the world's rapidly increasing population, to harvest the fragile tropical and boreal forests.},

In the coastal North American Pacific Northwest, we predicted the depletion risk of nitrogen (N), the region's most growth-limiting nutrient, for 68 intensively managed Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii [Mirb.] Franco) plantations varying widely in productivity. We projected stands to rotation age using the individual-tree growth model ORGANON and then calculated a stability ratio for each stand, defined as the ratio of N removed during harvest to total site N store (soil and forest floor). We assigned a risk rating to each site based on its stability ratio under whole-tree and stem-only harvest scenarios. Under whole-tree harvest, 49\% of sites were classified as potentially at risk of long-term N depletion (i.e., {$\geq$}10\% N store removed in harvest), whereas under stem-only harvest, only 24\% of sites were at risk. Six percent and 1\% of sites were classified as under high risk of N depletion (i.e., {$\geq$}30\% N store removed in harvest) under whole-tree and stem-only harvest, respectively. The simulation suggested that sites with \&lt;9.0 and \&lt;4.0 Mg ha-1 site N store are potentially at risk for long-term N depletion and productivity loss under repeated whole-tree and stem-only harvest, respectively. Sites with \&lt;2.2 and \&lt;0.9 Mg ha-1 site N store are at high risk of N depletion under whole-tree and stem-only harvest, respectively. The areas with the highest concentrations of at-risk sites were those with young, glacially derived soils on Vancouver Island, Canada, and in the Puget Sound region of Washington.},

PROFILE calculates the rates of cation release by mineral weathering and it then uses these data to calculate soil solution and runoff chemistry. No independent assessment of the underlying assumptions and data in the model has been published and this paper reports such an assessment. The rate equations, which are the key to the PROFILE model require rate coefficients and constants. These have been derived from the literature but more work is required to produce a consistent set of constants. Manipulation of these rates to take into account the exposed reactive surface area of the minerals is fraught with problems. Calculation of exposed mineral surface area from soil textural data results in under-estimates and the requirement to determine the surface area fraction of the different minerals in the soil to be known is extremely difficult if not impossible. Further uncertainty is introduced by adjustment of the rates to take into account temperature differences and by the use of a default mineralogy which is compositionally unrealistic. Despite its flaws PROFILE usually predicts similar weathering rates to other methods of calculation. It is argued that the unrealistic constraints imposed by the use of the surface area equation may be responsible for limiting calculated weathering rate to a fixed range which coincides with characteristically determined values for weathering rates.},

The rate of release of base cations will be governed by mineral composition and the exposed surface area of mineral grains. In theory it is possible to calculate the surface area of a mixture of grains on the basis of particle size and geometry. An alternative is the use of correlations. It has been suggested (Sverdrup et al. 1990, Nordic Council of Ministers 98) that mineral surface area can be related to soil particle size distribution via a simple empirical equation. This contribution compares the surface areas of soils as calculated by geometric equations and Sverdrup's equation with actual BET measurements. The equations tested do not appear to be applicable to the soils used in the current work. Modified versions of the equation suggested by Sverdrup, applied to subsets of our data, based on sites and soil types, yield better results for the soils used in the current work. Statistically significant improved fits are obtained when soil mineralogy as well as soil texture is taken into account.},

Change in mineral soil carbon content following harvest was negligible (+2\% ns). There was an increase of 184\% in forest floor carbon resulting from harvest residue inputs. Conventional methods of timber harvesting do not cause substantial short-term loss in mineral soil carbon. Forest soil carbon represents a large, but slowly changing pool of carbon in forests. Understanding the response of soil carbon to forest management, including harvesting, is critical for determining overall stand and/or landscape carbon balance. This longitudinal study on nine randomly selected sites was designed to detect a 5\% or greater change in mineral soil carbon storage following harvest. Soil samples were collected both pre-harvest and 3 to 3.5 yr post-harvest at 300 sample points on a fixed grid from each stand. A forest floor sample and mineral soil samples in depth increments of 0 to 15 and 15 to 30 cm were collected at every point. A soil sample at 30 to 100 cm (or 30\textendash 60 cm at two sites) was collected at 200 points. Each mineral soil depth fraction was separated into size fractions of {$<$}2 mm and 2 to 4.75 mm for analysis. At each site, these samples were spatially grouped into 25 composites by depth and size for the efficient analysis of carbon concentration. Soil mass and carbon concentrations were multiplied to calculate the carbon content in the soil per unit area. Across all sites combined, we found negligible change (+2\% ns) in mineral soil carbon content following harvest and a 184\% increase in forest floor carbon resulting from harvest residue inputs. This indicates that conventional timber harvesting methods in the Pacific Northwest do not cause substantial short-term losses in mineral soil carbon, but the longer-term trajectory of soil carbon storage following harvest remains to be investigated.},

Ecosystem-level estimates of Ca, Mg, and K pools and cycles in 50-year old Douglas-fir and red alder stands were used to determine the effect of overstory composition on net cation removal from the mineral soil, i.e. cation export from the soil in excess of additions. Net cation removal from Douglas-fir soil was 8 kg Ca ha-1 yr-1, 1 kg Mg ha-1 yr-1, and 0.3 kg K ha-1 yr-1. Annual cation export from soil by uptake and accumulation in live woody tissue and O horizon was of similar magnitude to leaching in soil solution. Atmospheric deposition partially off-set export by adding cations equivalent to 28\textendash 88\% of cation export. Net cation removal from red alder soil was 58 kg Ca ha-1 yr-1, 9 kg Mg ha-1 yr-1, and 11 kg K ha-1 yr-1. Annual cation accumulation in live woody tissue and O horizon was three times greater than in Douglas-fir, while cation leaching in soil solution was five to eight times greater. The lack of excessive depletion of exchangeable cations in the red alder soil suggests that mineral weathering, rather than exchangeable cations, was the source of most of the removed cations. Nitric acid generated during nitrification in red alder soil led to high rates of weathering and NO3-driven cation leaching.},

Therefore, the distribution and cycling of these nutrients can be closely related. However, the quantitative relationships between these elements in vegetation, as expressed by nutrient ratios (N:P and N:S), vary within trees and between biomes (Vitousek et al. 1988). Accumulation of organic matter and associated N and S in soil over long time periods can be strongly influenced by P dynamics (McGill and Christie 1983). Over shorter periods, stabilization and mineralization of organic N and P in soil are controlled by different factors; the control of organic S may be similar to N or P, depending on its chemical form (McGill and Cole 1981).},

  abstract = {Nitrogen (N) is a key nutrient that shapes cycles of other essential elements in forests, including calcium (Ca). When N availability exceeds ecosystem demands, excess N can stimulate Ca leaching and deplete Ca from soils. Over the long term, these processes may alter the proportion of available Ca that is derived from atmospheric deposition vs. bedrock weathering, which has fundamental consequences for ecosystem properties and nutrient supply. We evaluated how landscape variation in soil N, reflecting long-term legacies of biological N fixation, influenced plant and soil Ca availability and ecosystem Ca sources across 22 temperate forests in Oregon. We also examined interactions between soil N and bedrock Ca using soil N gradients on contrasting basaltic vs. sedimentary bedrock that differed 17-fold in underlying Ca content. We found that low-N forests on Ca-rich basaltic bedrock relied strongly on Ca from weathering, but that soil N enrichment depleted readily weatherable mineral Ca and shifted forest reliance toward atmospheric Ca. Forests on Ca-poor sedimentary bedrock relied more consistently on atmospheric Ca across all levels of soil N enrichment. The broad importance of atmospheric Ca was unexpected given active regional uplift and erosion that are thought to rejuvenate weathering supply of soil minerals. Despite different Ca sources to forests on basaltic vs. sedimentary bedrock, we observed consistent declines in plant and soil Ca availability with increasing N, regardless of the Ca content of underlying bedrock. Thus, traditional measures of Ca availability in foliage and soil exchangeable pools may poorly reflect long-term Ca sources that sustain soil fertility. We conclude that long-term soil N enrichment can deplete available Ca and cause forests to rely increasingly on Ca from atmospheric deposition, which may limit ecosystem Ca supply in an increasingly N-rich world.},

However, the role of soluble organic acids and humic substances on the adsorption of SO4 is poorly understood. Consequently, this study was conducted to determine the effects of soluble organic ligands on the adsorption of SO4 by amorphous iron oxide (AIO) and kaolinite (KGa-2). Adsorption experiments were conducted by titrating 50 mM K2SO4 with suspensions of KGa-2 (146-583 m2L-1) or AIO (324 m2L-1) in 0.01 M KCl, at pH 4.3 and 25 \textdegree C. Sulfate adsorption was studied over a range in total SO4 of 0.01 to 2.5 mM in the absence and presence of organic ligands including Seward humic and fulvic acid, tannic acid, citric acid, oxalic acid, and gallic acid. Sulfate adsorption capacities in the absence of organic ligands were 3.5 and 1.3 \textmu molc m-2 at 324 m2L-1 AIO and 583 m2L-1 KGa-2, respectively. Humic and tannic acid present at 1.4 to 3.6 mM total soluble C reduced SO4 adsorption by KGa-2 at total SO4 levels below 0.12 mM. Humic, tannic, citric, gallic, and oxalic acid were all effective at inhibiting SO4 adsorption by AIO. In several cases the percent of SO4 adsorbed was reduced from near 100 to zero at total SO4 levels below 0.12 mM. The amount of inhibition was related to the quantity of oxygen-containing functional groups added rather than the total soluble C. These results indicate that organic acids compete for SO4 adsorption sites and that the presence of organic acids in soil solutions will influence SO4 adsorption capacities.},

  abstract = {Field and laboratory data reported in this study indicate that the kind of mass movement and the mineralogy of the materials involved vary with the parent material. The clay fraction of debris avalanches is dominated primarily by nonexpanding layer silicates that have large particle sizes and small water-holding capacities. Dehydrated halloysite, chloritic intergrade, and mica were the common minerals in those areas underlain by sandstones and siltstones of the Tyee Formation as well as the massive basalt flowrock of the Siletz River Volcanic Series. The clay fraction of soils derived from Tertiary sandstones of the Galice and Lookingglass Formations is dominated by chloritic intergrade, chlorite, mica, and kaolinite. Serpentine, chlorite, and mica were the soil clays associated with debris avalances on serpentinite of the Otter Point Formation. Expandable layer silicates, or those with high charge or water-holding capacity, were not major constituents of debris avalanches although smectite and vermiculite commonly occurred in a thin layer of soil above the underlying bedrock. The clay fraction of samples from sites undergoing failure by creep and slump consisted primarily of smectite. Smectite, chloritic intergrade, dehydrated and hydrated halloysite, and mica were the minerals commonly associated with soil creep and slump on slopes underlain by siltstones of the Tyee Formation. Montmorillonite was the major constituent of a large rotational slump at the contact between the Nye Mudstone and the sandstones of the Astoria Formation. Smectite, chlorite, and serpentine were identified in sites underlain by serpentinite of the Otter Point Formation. The mineralogy of soils involved in earthflow consisted predominantly of hydrated and dehydrated halloysite, amorphous material, and chloritic intergrade. No difference in mineralogy could be detected between sites underlain by siltstones of the Tyee and Nestucca Formations and tuffaceous siltstones and tuff of the Siletz River Volcanic Series. Surface samples were more poorly crystallized than samples taken at lower horizons. Electron micrographs reveal an abundance of amorphous gels and ``coatings'' on the surface of mineral grains. The abundance of ``pores'' may account for the fluid behavior of these materials during failure.},

  abstract = {Tree harvest and different harvesting methods may affect the soil carbon  (C) pool in forest ecosystems. In conventional stem-only timber harvesting (SOH), branches and tops that are left in the forests may contribute to the build-up of the soil carbon pool. In whole-tree harvesting (WTH), inputs of organic matter from branches and tops are strongly reduced. We established field experiments at Gaupen, SE and Vindberg, SW Norway, to study the short-term effects of SOH and WTH on processes affecting the accumulation and loss of soil C. Logging residues on the WTH plots were collected in piles that were removed after 6 months, rendering two sub treatments (WTH-pile and WTH-removal areas). We weighed selected trees and logging residues, surveyed understorey biomass production, quantified pre-harvest soil C and nutrient pools down to 30 cm. Soil respiration was measured and soil water sampled monthly during the growing season, while temperature and moisture were measured continuously. Organic and mineral horizons were incubated at different temperatures to estimate potential C and N mineralization, and deep sequencing of the ITS2 barcode region of fungal DNA was performed on the samples. Litterbags were deployed in the SOH plots. The logging residues amounted to 2.2-2.4 kg C m-2. At Gaupen, the mean in situ soil respiration rates increased following harvest with all treatments, but were significantly higher in WTH-pile and SOH relative to the WTH-removal areas in the first year as well as the fourth year of treatment. The former rates included aboveground decomposing needles and twigs but excluded coarser branches. The observed increase in the WTH-removal areas may be related to decomposing roots, as well as to increased C mineralization partly due to the higher soil temperatures following harvest. Soil temperature was the single most important factor explaining the variability in soil respiration rates over all treatments. At Vindberg, a decrease in soil respiration was observed with all treatments in the second and third years following harvest. At both sites, decomposition of logging residues from needles was more rapid relative to twigs and fine roots. The decomposing residues released a substantial amount of nitrogen which was gradually reflected in the soil water at 30 cm soil depth. A considerable increase in the NO3-N concentration also in the WTH-removal areas in the second year following harvest suggests an increase in N availability from decomposing fine roots and/or soil organic matter. The increased N availability in the WTH-removal areas was supported by results from short term lab incubations of undisturbed soil from the forest floor. The changes in the WTH-removal areas were also reflected in the soil fungal diversity: saprophytic ascomycetes on decaying plant material showed a striking increase in all treatments. For the WTH-removal areas, this may, again, be related to the increased input of root litter; however, the decrease in mycorrhizal basidiomycete species and the vigorous increase of ascomycetes following harvest may also affect the C mineralization of soil organic matter.},

Here, we focus on the controls on canopy conductance (gc), E, GPP and water use efficiency (WUE) and the effect of interannual climate variability at the intermediate-aged stand (DF49) and then analyze the effects of stand age following clearcut harvesting on these characteristics. Daytime dry-foliage Priestley\textendash Taylor {$\alpha$} and gc at DF49 were 0.4\textendash 0.8 and 2\textendash 6mms-1, respectively, and were linearly correlated (R2=0.65). Low values of {$\alpha$} and gc at DF49 as well at the other two stands suggested stomatal limitation to transpiration. Monthly E, however, showed strong positive linear correlations to monthly net radiation (R2=0.94), air temperature (R2=0.77), and daytime vapour pressure deficit (R2=0.76). During July\textendash September, monthly E (mm) was linearly correlated to monthly mean soil water content (\texttheta, m3m-3) in the 0\textendash 60cm layer (E=453\texttheta -21, R2=0.69), and GPP was similarly affected. Annual E and GPP of DF49 for the period 1998\textendash 2007 varied from 370 to 430mm and from 1950 to 2390gCm-2, respectively. After clearcut harvesting, E dropped to about 70\% of that for DF49 while ecosystem evapotranspiration was fully recovered when stand age was {$\sim$}12 years. This contrasted to GPP, which varied hyperbolically with stand age. Monthly GPP showed a strong positive linear relationship with E irrespective of the stand age. While annual WUE of HDF00 and HDF88 varied with age from 0.5 to 4.1gCm-2kg-1 and from 2.8 to 4.4gCm-2kg-1, respectively, it was quite conservative at {$\sim$}5.3gCm-2kg-1 for DF49. N-fertilization had little first-year response on E and WUE. This study not only provides important results for a more detailed validation of process-based models but also helps in predicting the influences of climate change and forest management on water vapour and CO2 fluxes in Douglas-fir forests.},

  abstract = {Nutrient transport from forest ecosystems is strongly regulated by the availability of anions in soil solution. Each of the major anions in forest soil solutions has some unique properties which affect its production and mobility. The production of bicarbonate, one of the most common anions, is regulated by soil CO2 pressure and pH. The mobility of phosphate is most strongly affected by adsorption reactions. The mobility of nitrate is regulated almost solely by biological processes, whereas chloride is relatively uninvolved in either biological or inorganic chemical reactions. Sulfate is intermediate, being involved in both biological and inorganic chemical reactions. Knowing these properties of the major anions, it is possible to assess and to predict the effects of several diverse site manipulations on soil leaching rates. Case studies from a site in Washington State consistently demonstrate the importance of accounting for bicarbonate transformations following site manipulations. Although organic anions are frequently dominant in cold-region soil solutions, very little information on the complex factors affecting their mobilities is available. Further research into organic anion mobility and futher attention to bicarbonate mobility should add greatly to the body of knowledge on nutrient transport processes in forest soils.},

The IFS is unique as an applied research project in its complete, ecosystem-level evaluation of nutrient budgets, including significant inputs, outputs, and internal fluxes. It is also noteworthy as a more basic investigation of ecosystem nutrient cycling because of its incorporation of state-of-the-art methods, such as quantifying dry and cloud water deposition. Most significantly, the IFS data was used to test several general hypotheses regarding atmospheric deposition and its effects. The data sets also allow for far-reaching conclusions because all sites were monitored over the same period using comparable instruments and standardized protocols.},

  abstract = {The discovery of acidic deposition caused concern that forest nutritional problems and forest growth decline would result from increased base cation leaching from soils. This concern stimulated many analyses of cation budgets in forest ecosystems (see review by Johnson et al. 1982), including detailed analyses of H+ deposition vs internal H+ production (e.g., Ulrich 1980; Binkley and Richter, 1987). H+ budgets highlighted the great importance of tree uptake in causing soil acidification, but even when this was included in the analysis, budget analyses usually indicated little possibility for soil acidification or cation nutrient depletion in anything less than many decades or centuries (McFee 1980; Johnson et al. 1985). However, recent field evidence shows that some soils can experience significant changes in only one to two decades (e.g., Berden et al. 1987; Johnson et al. 1988; Binkley et al. 1989). As the issue of acidic deposition and forest decline unfolds, the importance of nutrient cycling analysis in understanding the cause-effect relationships in this phenomenon has also become very clear (Ulrich 1980; Johnson et al. 1985, 1991; Schulze 1989).},

Inorganically driven processes such as weathering, cation exchange, and soil leaching are often considerably more important in base cation cycles than in the cycles of N, P, and S, whereas organic processes such as heterotrophic immobilization and oxidation are typically less important (Figure 8.1). The fact that Ca, K, and Mg exist primarily as cations in solution whereas N, P, and S exist primarily as anions has major implications for the cycling of these nutrients and the effects of acid deposition upon these cycles. The introduction of H+, whether by atmospheric deposition or by internal processes, will directly impact the fluxes of Ca, K, and Mg via cation exchange or weathering processes. Thus, soil leaching is often of major importance in cation cycles, and many forest ecosystems show a net loss of base cations (in contrast to net gains of N and P; Cole and Rapp 1981).},

Field comparisons of limed and unlimed soils after 23 yr indicated substantial net retention of applied Ca2+ and Mg2+ in upper soil horizons, even in black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia L.) sites where NO-3 leaching was elevated. We hypothesized that NuCM simulations would also show that (i) retention of most applied Ca2+ and Mg2+ in the upper horizons and (ii) increased Ca2+ and Mg2+ retention with increased cation exchange capacity (CEC) and exchangeable H+ (simulating pH-dependent CEC). Both hypotheses were supported by simulation results for Ca2+, but not for Mg2+. Most applied Mg2+ in the simulations was retained in the BC horizon, where the largest pool of exchangeable Mg2+ was initially located. Increasing CEC and exchangeable H+ did result in increased retention of applied Ca2+ and Mg2+ in surface horizons. However, increasing CEC caused lower Mg2+ retention in the BC horizon, which offset the surface horizon increases and resulted in lower total retention of applied Mg2+. Simulated BC horizon soil solution concentrations mimicked the general patterns in streamwater NO-3, Mg2+, Na+, Cl-, SO2-4, and K+ between 1971 (12 yr after liming) and 1979. NuCM simulations did not, nor was it possible to simulate the observed effects of an insect outbreak on streamwater NO-3.},

  abstract = {The nutrient cycling model (NuCM) is a stand level model that depicts the cycling of N, P, K, Ca, Mg, and S on daily, weekly or monthly time scales. NuCM has been applied to several forest ecosystems (ponderosa pine, red spruce, beech, eastern deciduous, loblolly pine, slash pine, Scots pine, and Norway spruce) to simulate the effects of changing atmospheric deposition, harvesting, species change, precipitation quantity, increased temperature, elevated CO2, and liming. In some cases (e.g., harvesting, liming), the model output has matched field data quite well; however, it cannot be known whether the model does so because it accurately portrays nutrient cycling processes or simply because of chance. In other cases, NuCM simulations have either failed to match field data (as in the case of the observed chromatographic response of soil solution cations to a nitrate pulse in a beech forest) or produced results that are counterintuitive but as yet untested (as in the case where increased N translocation caused increased leaching). In that the primary purpose of these simulations has been heuristic rather than predictive, the simulation outputs that are either inconsistent with field data or counter-intuitive are of greatest interest. This review of NuCM applications led to the conclusion that the model has been more successful in matching decadal-scale changes in nutrient pools and soils and less successful in capturing intra-annual variations in soil solution chemistry. The NuCM model, like all models, can use improvements and these have been suggested; however, the model as it is has provided valuable insights into nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems, including the potential for short-term soil change and the great importance of nutrient translocation in N cycling.},

The unsaturated transient flow method has been developed for determining adsorption isotherms for weakly reactive ions without causing excessive desorption of strongly adsorbed native ions. The objective of this study was to extend the method to determine NO3 - adsorption isotherms in an Andisol in the absence or presence of Cl competing for the adsorption sites Kannondai subsoil (Hydric Hapludand), premixed with a Ca(NO3)2 or CaCl2-Ca(NO3)2 solution at different concentrations, was packed into sectionable columns, and one-dimensional water absorption experiments were conducted. Anion adsorption by soil, Q n, and the liquid-phase concentration, C n, prior to the water imbibition were obtained from the plots of the anion content vs. water content in the region beyond the `plane of separation,' where the antecedent solution was accumulated. The values of Qn and C n found in a series of column experiments were then used to construct the isotherms describing the solution composition-dependent adsorption of NO3 - and Cl-. e fitted to Langmuir-type equations, the maximum adsorption for NO3 - (Qmax= 27,1-29.0 mmolc kg-1) was consistently smaller than that for Cl- (Qmax = 455 46.1 mmolc kg-1), while the empirical constant K (= 0.0238 - 0.0274 m3 molc -1) was insensitive to the anion species. The anion content profiles predicted by the inferred adsorption isotherms closely agreed with the measured content profiles.},

  abstract = {Litterfall and its subsequent decomposition are important feedback mechanisms in the intrasystem cycling of nutrients in forest ecosystems. The amount of litterfall and the rate of decomposition are expected to vary with stand age and climate. Over a 2-year period, decomposition of five litter types were measured in two second-growth forest stands and one old-growth stand in the Cascade Mountains of southern Washington state, USA. Both second-growth stands were dominated by Douglas-fir [Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.,) Franco] but one had a significant proportion of red alder (Alnus rubra Bong.), a nitrogen (N) fixer. The old-growth stand was dominated by Douglas-fir and western hemlock [Tsuga heterophylla (Raf.) Sarg.]. All stands had a relatively shallow layer of forest floor mass. The five litter types were placed in each stand to evaluate decomposition patterns. Despite significant differences in stand age, microclimate and mean residence times for carbon (C) and N, the rates of litter mass loss varied only slightly between sites. The relative order of species litter mass loss was: vine maple {$>$} salal = western hemlock {$>$} Douglas-fir (from the youngest stand) {$>$} Douglas-fir (from the N rich stand with red alder). The initial litter lignin concentration, not lignin: N, was the primary determinant of decomposition rates, although the initial N concentration was the predictor for mass loss after 2 years in the N rich Douglasfir-alder stand. All litter types showed immobilization of N for nearly 2 years. Data for Douglas-fir litter suggest that higher levels of N may retard decomposition of tissues with greater amounts of lignified material. The retention of N by the litter appeared influenced by the nutrient capital of the stands as well as the forest floor C: N ratio. Decomposition was minimal during the cold winter months, but displayed a definitive peak period during early Fall with wet weather, warm soils, and fungal activity. Thus, longterm climatic change effects on forest floor C storage may depend more on changes in seasonally of precipitation changes than just temperature changes.},

  abstract = {Among the various plant nutrients, calcium appears to occupy a unique position, acting as an important regulator in many processes related to both growth and responses to environmental stresses. This applies to stomatal function, cell division, cell wall synthesis, signalling functions in plant defence, repair of damage from biotic and abiotic stress and to the structural chemistry and function of woody tissues. The calcium content in the cambium of poplar was shown to rise transiently by as much as 40\% in spring, indicating the significant role that calcium plays in the onset of cambial reactivation. Moreover, during bud flush and the beginning of cell division, calcium was reported to increase significantly in the apical meristem. A reduction in calcium supplies also proved to strongly affect wood formation, as evidenced in the pronounced reduction in wood increment, vessel size and fibre length, as well as in reduced carbonyl and methoxy groups from S-lignin. Induced wounding revealed that calcium acts as an intracellular signal and, furthermore, proved its involvement in long-distance electrical signalling. Environmental stimuli such as cold shock or wounding showed that poplar grown under calcium-starved conditions was incapable of responding to this type of stress. The above evidence highlights the important role of calcium in tree functions, both as a signal in minute physiologically active pools within the cytoplasm, and in higher concentrations for its impact on the structural integrity of cell walls and woody tissues.},

We tested the hypothesis that N limitation is widespread among biomes and influenced by geography and climate. We used the response ratio (R {$\cong$} ANPPN/ANPPctrl) of aboveground plant growth in fertilized to control plots and found that most ecosystems are nitrogen limited with an average 29\% growth response to nitrogen (i.e., R = 1.29). The response ratio was significant within temperate forests (R = 1.19), tropical forests (R = 1.60), temperate grasslands (R = 1.53), tropical grasslands (R = 1.26), wetlands (R = 1.16), and tundra (R = 1.35), but not deserts. Eight tropical forest studies had been conducted on very young volcanic soils in Hawaii, and this subgroup was strongly N limited (R = 2.13), which resulted in a negative correlation between forest R and latitude. The degree of N limitation in the remainder of the tropical forest studies (R = 1.20) was comparable to that of temperate forests, and when the young Hawaiian subgroup was excluded, forest R did not vary with latitude. Grassland response increased with latitude, but was independent of temperature and precipitation. These results suggest that the global N and C cycles interact strongly and that geography can mediate ecosystem response to N within certain biome types.},

  abstract = {Forest plantation is a widely used silvicultural practice throughout Europe most particularly to renew planted forest stands. The long term impact of forest plantations on soil fertility is a major concern for forest managers and policy makers, in particular in the context of global change because forests endure increased climatic and/or silvicultural and/or nutritional pressure. In the present study we investigated the tree species effects on soil solution chemistry and major elements fluxes, to better understand the impact of tree species on soil processes and fertility. The chemical composition of throughfall and soil solutions were compared between six 35-year-old monospecific stands (Norway spruce, Corsican pine, sessile oak, European beech, Douglas fir and Nordmann fir) and the reference plot (beech and oak coppice with standards) of the common garden experiment at the Breuil-Chenue Experimental site (Burgundy, France). Tree species had a strong effect on the chemistry of throughfall and soil solution, in particular on the relative contribution of nitrate, sulfate and dissolved organic carbon to the anionic charge. Mean concentrations of major elements varied widely between stands. Nitrate concentrations were highest for the Douglas fir and Corsican pine probably due to the tree species effect on nitrification processes. In both stands, the nitrate leaching causes large acidification with high drainage losses of magnesium, calcium and monomeric aluminum. For Norway spruce, sessile oak, European beech and reference plot, sulfate and dissolved organic carbon were the main anionic drivers for solution chemistry and nutrient fluxes. Soil acidification processes were less intense in these stands and aluminum was mainly transported in the soil profile by Al-cheluviation by dissolved organic compounds. The results of this study suggest that tree species strongly influence the chemistry of throughfall and soil solutions and may strongly influence on the short-term (35years) soil pedogenic processes from weak acidification and crypto-podzolisation to strong soil acidification.},

  abstract = {A synthesis of the biogeochemistry of Ca was done during 1963-1992 in reference and human-manipulated forest ecosystems of the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (HBEF), NH. Results showed that there has been a marked decline in concentration and input of Ca in bulk precipitation, an overall decline in concentration and output of Ca in stream water, and marked depletion of Ca in soils of the HBEF since 1963. The decline in streamwater Ca was related strongly to a decline in SO\textsubscript{4}\textsuperscript{2-}+NO\textsubscript{3}\textsuperscript{-} in stream water during the period. The soil depletion of Ca was the result of leaching due to inputs of acid rain during the past 50 yr or so, to decreasing atmospheric inputs of Ca, and to changing amounts of net storage of Ca in biomass. As a result of the depletion of Ca, forest ecosystems at HBEF are much more sensitive to continuing inputs of strong acids in atmospheric deposition than expected based on long-term patterns of sulfur biogeochemistry. The Ca concentration and input in bulk precipitation ranged from a low of 1.0 {$\mu$}mol/l and 15 mol/ha-yr in 1986-87 to a high of 8.0 {$\mu$}mol/l and 77 mol/ha-yr in 1964-65, with a long-term mean of 2.74 {$\mu$}mol/l during 1963-92. Average total atmospheric deposition was 61 and 29 mol/ha-yr in 1964-69 and 1987-92, respectively. Dry deposition is difficult to measure, but was estimated to be about 20\% of total input in atmospheric deposition. Streamwater concentration reached a low of 21 {$\mu$}mol/l in 1991-92 and a high of 41 {$\mu$}mol/l in 1969-70, but outputs of Ca were lowest in 1964-65 (121 mol/ha-yr) and peaked in 1973-74 (475 mol/ha-yr). Gross outputs of Ca in stream water were positively and significantly related to streamflow, but the slope of this relation changed with time as Ca was depleted from the soil, and as the inputs of sulfate declined in both atmospheric deposition and stream water. Gross outputs of Ca in stream water consistently exceeded inputs in bulk precipitation. No seasonal pattern was observed for either bulk precipitation or streamwater concentrations of Ca. Net soil release varied from 390 to 230 mol/ha-yr during 1964-69 and 1987-92, respectively. Of this amount, weathering release of Ca, based on plagioclase composition of the soil, was estimated at about 50 mol/ha-yr. Net biomass storage of Ca decreased from 202 to 54 mol/ha-yr, and throughfall plus stemflow decreased from 220 to 110 mol/ha-yr in 1964-69 and 1987-92, respectively. These ecosystem response patterns were related to acidification and to decreases in net biomass accretion during the study. Calcium return to soil by fine root turnover was about 270 mol/ha-yr, with 190 mol/ha-yr returning to the forest floor and 80 mol/ha-yr to the mineral soil. A lower content of Ca was observed with increasing elevation for most of the components of the watershed-ecosystems at HBEF. Possibly as a result, mortality of sugar maple increased significantly during 1982 to 1992 at high elevations of the HBEF. Interactions between biotic and abiotic control mechanisms were evident through elevational differences in soil cation exchange capacity (the exchangeable Ca concentration in soils was significantly and directly related to the organic matter content of the soils), in soil/till depth, and in soil water and in streamwater concentrations at the HBEF, all of which tended to decrease with elevation. The exchangeable pool of Ca in the soil is about 6500 mol/ha, and its turnover time is quite rapid, about 3 yr. Nevertheless, the exchangeable pools of Ca at HBEF have been depleted markedly during the past 50 years or so, {$>$}21, 125 mol/ha during 1940-1995. The annual gross uptake of trees is about 26-30\% of the exchangeable pool in the soil. Some 7 to 8 times more Ca is cycled through trees than is lost in stream water each year, and resorption of Ca by trees is negligible at HBEF. Of the current inputs to the available nutrient compartment of the forest ecosystem, some 50\% was provided by net soil release, 24\% by leaching from the canopy, 20\% by root exudates and 6\% by atmospheric deposition. Clear cutting released large amounts of Ca to stream water, primarily because increased nitrification in the soil generated increased acidity and NO\textsubscript{3}\textsuperscript{-}, a mobile anion in drainage water; even larger amounts of Ca can be lost from the ecosystem in harvested timber products. The magnitude of Ca loss due to whole-tree harvest and acid rain leaching is comparable for forests similar to the HBEF, but losses from harvest must be superimposed on losses due to acid rain.},

  abstract = {All vegetation on Watershed 2 of the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest was cut during November and December of 1965, and vegetation regrowth was inhibited for two years by periodic application of herbicides. Annual stream\textemdash flow was increased 33 cm or 39\% the first year and 27 cm or 28\% the second year above the values expected if the watershed were not deforested. Large increases in streamwater concentration were observed for all major ions, except NH4+, SO4 = and HCO3\textemdash, approximately five months after the deforestation. Nitrate concentrations were 41\textemdash fold higher than the undisturbed condition the first year and 56\textemdash fold higher the second. The nitrate concentration in stream water has exceeded, almost continuously, the health levels recommended for drinking water. Sulfate was the only major ion in stream water that decreased in concentration after deforestation. An inverse relationship between sulfate and nitrate concentrations in stream water was observed in both undisturbed and deforested situations. Average streamwater concentrations increased by 417\% for Ca++, 408\% for Mg++, 1558\% for K+ and 177\% for Na+ during the two years subsequent to deforestation. Budgetary net losses from Watershed 2 in kg/ha\textemdash yr were about 142 for NO3\textemdash N, 90 for Ca++, 36 for K+, 32 for SiO2\textemdash Si, 24 for Al+++, 18 for Mg++, 17 for Na+, 4 for Cl\textemdash, and 0 for SO4\textemdash S during 1967\textemdash 68; whereas for an adjacent, undisturbed watershed (W6) net losses were 9.2 for Ca++, 1.6 for K+, 17 for SiO2\textemdash Si, 3.1 for A1+++, 2.6 for Mg++, 7.0 for Na+, 0.1 for C1\textemdash, and 3.3 for SO4\textemdash S. Input of nitrate\textemdash nitrogen in precipitation normally exceeds the output in drainage water in the undisturbed ecosystems, and ammonium\textemdash nitrogen likewise accumulates in both the undisturbed and deforested ecosystems. Total gross export of dissolved solids, exclusive of organic matter, was about 75 metric tons/km2 in 1966\textemdash 67, and 97 metric tons/km2 in 1967\textemdash 68, or about 6 to 8 times greater than would be expected for an undisturbed watershed. The greatly increased export of dissolved nutrients from the deforested ecosystem was due to an alteration of the nitrogen cycle within the ecosystem. The drainage streams tributary to Hubbard Brook are normally acid, and as a result of deforestation the hydrogen ion content increased by 5\textemdash fold (from pH 5.1 to 4.3). Streamwater temperatures after deforestation were higher than the undisturbed condition during both summer and winter. Also in contrast to the relatively constant temperature in the undisturbed streams, streamwater temperature after deforestation fluctuated 3\textemdash 4\textdegree C during the day in summer. Electrical conductivity increased about 6\textemdash fold in the stream water after deforestation and was much more variable. Increased streamwater turbidity as a result of the deforestation was negligible, however the particulate matter output was increased about 4\textemdash fold. Whereas the particulate matter is normally 50\% inorganic materials, after deforestation preliminary estimates indicate that the proportion of inorganic materials increased to 76\% of the total particulates. Supersaturation of dissolved oxygen in stream water from the experimental watersheds is common in all seasons except summer when stream discharge is low. The percent saturation is dependent upon flow rate in the streams. Sulfate, hydrogen ion and nitrate are major constituents in the precipitation. It is suggested that the increase in average nitrate concentration in precipitation compared to data from 1955\textemdash 56,as well as the consistent annual increase observed from 1964 to 1968, may be some measure of a general increase in air pollution.},

  abstract = {Studies of nutrient limitation in Douglas-fir forests of the Pacific Northwest focus predominantly on nitrogen, yet many stands demonstrate negligible or even negative growth response to nitrogen fertilization. To understand what nutrients other than nitrogen may limit forest productivity in this region, we tested six fertilizer treatments for their ability to increase stem volume growth response of dominant and co-dominant trees in young Douglas-fir plantations across a range of foliar and soil chemistry in western Oregon and Washington. We evaluated responses to single applications of urea, lime, calcium chloride, or monosodium phosphate at 16 sites, and to two site-specific nutrients blends at 12 of these sites. Across sites, the average stem volume growth increased marginally with urea, lime, and phosphorus fertilization. Fertilization responses generally aligned with plant and soil indicators of nutrient limitation. Response to nitrogen addition was greatest on soils with low total nitrogen and high exchangeable calcium concentrations. Responses to lime and calcium chloride additions were greatest at sites with low foliar calcium and low soil pH. Response to phosphorus addition was greatest on sites with low foliar phosphorus and high soil pH. Blended fertilizers yielded only marginal growth increases at one site, with no consistent effect across sites. Overall, our results highlight that calcium and phosphorus can be important growth limiting nutrients on specific sites in nitrogen-rich Douglas-fir forests of the Pacific Northwest.},

  abstract = {Previous work has shown that tree turnover, tree biomass and large liana densities have increased in mature tropical forest plots in the late twentieth century. These results point to a concerted shift in forest ecological processes that may already be having significant impacts on terrestrial carbon stocks, fluxes and biodiversity. However, the findings have proved controversial, partly because a rather limited number of permanent plots have been monitored for rather short periods. The aim of this paper is to characterize regional\textendash scale patterns of `tree turnover' (the rate with which trees die and recruit into a population) by using improved datasets now available for Amazonia that span the past 25 years. Specifically, we assess whether concerted changes in turnover are occurring, and if so whether they are general throughout the Amazon or restricted to one region or environmental zone. In addition, we ask whether they are driven by changes in recruitment, mortality or both. We find that: (i) trees 10 cm or more in diameter recruit and die twice as fast on the richer soils of southern and western Amazonia than on the poorer soils of eastern and central Amazonia; (ii) turnover rates have increased throughout Amazonia over the past two decades; (iii) mortality and recruitment rates have both increased significantly in every region and environmental zone, with the exception of mortality in eastern Amazonia; (iv) recruitment rates have consistently exceeded mortality rates; (v) absolute increases in recruitment and mortality rates are greatest in western Amazonian sites; and (vi) mortality appears to be lagging recruitment at regional scales. These spatial patterns and temporal trends are not caused by obvious artefacts in the data or the analyses. The trends cannot be directly driven by a mortality driver (such as increased drought or fragmentation\textendash related death) because the biomass in these forests has simultaneously increased. Our findings therefore indicate that long\textendash acting and widespread environmental changes are stimulating the growth and productivity of Amazon forests.},

However, poor understanding of the mechanisms responsible hinders the development of effective land management strategies to enhance soil carbon storage. Here we empirically test the link between microbial ecophysiological traits and topsoil carbon content across geographically distributed soils and land use contrasts. We discovered distinct pH controls on microbial mechanisms of carbon accumulation. Land use intensification in low-pH soils that increased the pH above a threshold (\textasciitilde 6.2) leads to carbon loss through increased decomposition, following alleviation of acid retardation of microbial growth. However, loss of carbon with intensification in near-neutral pH soils was linked to decreased microbial biomass and reduced growth efficiency that was, in turn, related to trade-offs with stress alleviation and resource acquisition. Thus, less-intensive management practices in near-neutral pH soils have more potential for carbon storage through increased microbial growth efficiency, whereas in acidic soils, microbial growth is a bigger constraint on decomposition rates.},

While it is a fact that increased biomass harvesting generates greater nutrient losses from forest ecosystems relative to stem-only harvesting, the use of nutrient budget approaches as a decision support tool in managing forests under intensive biomass removal is uncommon. This lack of use can be explained by several factors including: large uncertainties in predicting certain fluxes, the poor representation of nutrient dynamics following harvest in nutrient cycling models, the lack of representation of biological feedback, the lack of appropriate validation, and finally the lack of maps of specific soil properties that would be required to predict nutrient budgets over forest landscapes. This review documents the impact of intensive biomass extraction on nutrient cycling and discusses the gaps in knowledge and the uncertainties associated with nutrient budgets. It identifies research and development issues that need to be resolved for making forest nutrient budgets more reliable and more useful to address the questions regarding the environmental sustainability of intensive biomass harvesting.},

We characterized plant production, N uptake and return in litterfall, soil gross and net N mineralization rates, and hydrologic N losses of nine Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) forests across a wide soil N gradient in the Oregon Coast Range (USA). Surface mineral soil N (0\textendash 10 cm) ranged nearly three-fold from 0.29\% to 0.78\% N, and in contrast to predictions of N-saturation theory, was linearly related to 10-fold variation in net N mineralization, from 8 to 82 kg N{$\cdot$}ha-1{$\cdot$}yr-1. Net N mineralization was unrelated to soil C:N, soil texture, precipitation, and temperature differences among sites. Net nitrification was negatively related to soil pH, and accounted for {$<$}20\% of net N mineralization at low-N sites, increasing to 85\textendash 100\% of net N mineralization at intermediate- and high-N sites. The ratio of net : gross N mineralization and nitrification increased along the gradient, indicating progressive saturation of microbial N demands at high soil N. Aboveground N uptake by plants increased asymptotically with net N mineralization to a peak of {$\sim$}35 kg N{$\cdot$}ha-1{$\cdot$}yr-1. Aboveground net primary production per unit net N mineralization varied inversely with soil N, suggesting progressive saturation of plant N demands at high soil N. Hydrologic N losses were dominated by dissolved organic N at low-N sites, with increased nitrate loss causing a shift to dominance by nitrate at high-N sites, particularly where net nitrification exceeded plant N demands. With the exception of N mineralization patterns, our results broadly support the application of the N-saturation model developed from studies of anthropogenic N deposition to understand N cycling and saturation of plant and microbial sinks along natural soil N gradients. This convergence of behavior in unpolluted and polluted forest N cycles suggests that where future reductions in deposition to polluted sites do occur, symptoms of N saturation are most likely to persist where soil N content remains elevated.},

  abstract = {Nitrogen (N) is a critical limiting nutrient that regulates plant productivity and the cycling of other essential elements in forests. We measured foliar and soil nutrients in 22 young Douglas-fir stands in the Oregon Coast Range to examine patterns of nutrient availability across a gradient of N-poor to N-rich soils. N in surface mineral soil ranged from 0.15 to 1.05\% N, and was positively related to a doubling of foliar N across sites. Foliar N in half of the sites exceeded 1.4\% N, which is considered above the threshold of N-limitation in coastal Oregon Douglas-fir. Available nitrate increased five-fold across this gradient, whereas exchangeable magnesium (Mg) and calcium (Ca) in soils declined, suggesting that nitrate leaching influences base cation availability more than soil parent material across our sites. Natural abundance strontium isotopes ({$^{87}$}Sr/{$^{86}$}Sr) of a single site indicated that 97\% of available base cations can originate from atmospheric inputs of marine aerosols, with negligible contributions from weathering. Low annual inputs of Ca relative to Douglas-fir growth requirements may explain why foliar Ca concentrations are highly sensitive to variations in soil Ca across our sites. Natural abundance calcium isotopes ({$\delta^{44}$}Ca) in exchangeable and acid leachable pools of surface soil measured at a single site showed 1 per mil depletion relative to deep soil, suggesting strong Ca recycling to meet tree demands. Overall, the biogeochemical response of these Douglas-fir forests to gradients in soil N is similar to changes associated with chronic N deposition in more polluted temperate regions, and raises the possibility that Ca may be deficient on excessively N-rich sites. We conclude that wide gradients in soil N can drive non-linear changes in base-cation biogeochemistry, particularly as forests cross a threshold from N-limitation to N-saturation. The most acute changes may occur in forests where base cations are derived principally from atmospheric inputs.},

  abstract = {High nitrogen (N) accumulation in terrestrial ecosystems can shift patterns of nutrient limitation and deficiency beyond N toward other nutrients, most notably phosphorus (P) and base cations (calcium [Ca], magnesium [Mg], and potassium [K]). We examined how naturally high N accumulation from a legacy of symbiotic N fixation shaped P and base cation cycling across a gradient of nine temperate conifer forests in the Oregon Coast Range. We were particularly interested in whether long-term legacies of symbiotic N fixation promoted coupled N and organic P accumulation in soils, and whether biotic demands by non-fixing vegetation could conserve ecosystem base cations as N accumulated. Total soil N (0\textendash 100 cm) pools increased nearly threefold across the N gradient, leading to increased nitrate leaching, declines in soil pH from 5.8 to 4.2, 10-fold declines in soil exchangeable Ca, Mg, and K, and increased mobilization of aluminum. These results suggest that long-term N enrichment had acidified soils and depleted much of the readily weatherable base cation pool. Soil organic P increased with both soil N and C across the gradient, but soil inorganic P, biomass P, and P leaching loss did not vary with N, implying that historic symbiotic N fixation promoted soil organic P accumulation and P sufficiency for non-fixers. Even though soil pools of Ca, Mg, and K all declined as soil N increased, only Ca declined in biomass pools, suggesting the emergence of Ca deficiency at high N. Biotic conservation and tight recycling of Ca increased in response to whole-ecosystem Ca depletion, as indicated by preferential accumulation of Ca in biomass and surface soil. Our findings support a hierarchical model of coupled N\textendash Ca cycling under long-term soil N enrichment, whereby ecosystem-level N saturation and nitrate leaching deplete readily available soil Ca, stimulating biotic Ca conservation as overall supply diminishes. We conclude that a legacy of biological N fixation can increase N and P accumulation in soil organic matter to the point that neither nutrient is limiting to subsequent non-fixers, while also resulting in natural N saturation that intensifies base cation depletion and deficiency.},

  abstract = {Tree species that form symbioses with nitrogen-fixing bacteria can naturally fertilize forests by converting atmospheric nitrogen gas into plant-available forms. However, other mineral nutrients that plants require for growth are largely locked in bedrock, and are released only slowly into soil. We used strontium isotopes to trace nutrient sources for six common tree species in a temperate rainforest, including one species from a globally widespread genus known for high rates of biological nitrogen fixation. We found that trees capable of fixing atmospheric nitrogen gas were also best able to directly access mineral nutrients from bedrock. This gives nitrogen-fixing trees the unique ability to provide the full suite of essential nutrients required to fuel growth and carbon uptake in forest ecosystems.Symbiotic nitrogen (N)-fixing trees supply significant N inputs to forest ecosystems, leading to increased soil fertility, forest growth, and carbon storage. Rapid growth and stoichiometric constraints of N fixers also create high demands for rock-derived nutrients such as phosphorus (P), while excess fixed N can generate acidity and accelerate leaching of rock-derived nutrients such as calcium (Ca). This ability of N-fixing trees to accelerate cycles of Ca, P, and other rock-derived nutrients has fostered speculation of a direct link between N fixation and mineral weathering in terrestrial ecosystems. However, field evidence that N-fixing trees have enhanced access to rock-derived nutrients is lacking. Here we use strontium (Sr) isotopes as a tracer of nutrient sources in a mixed-species temperate rainforest to show that N-fixing trees access more rock-derived nutrients than nonfixing trees. The N-fixing tree red alder (Alnus rubra), on average, took up 8 to 18\% more rock-derived Sr than five co-occurring nonfixing tree species, including two with high requirements for rock-derived nutrients. The increased access to rock-derived nutrients occurred despite spatial variation in community-wide Sr sources across the forest, and only N fixers had foliar Sr isotopes that differed significantly from soil exchangeable pools. We calculate that increased uptake of rock-derived nutrients by N-fixing alder requires a 64\% increase in weathering supply of nutrients over nonfixing trees. These findings provide direct evidence that an N-fixing tree species can also accelerate nutrient inputs from rock weathering, thus increasing supplies of multiple nutrients that limit carbon uptake and storage in forest ecosystems.},

All the samples adsorbed amounts of phosphate 2\textendash 5 times greater than those of sulfate. By increasing pH, phosphate adsorption only slightly decreased, whereas sulfate retention decreased dramatically. At pH{$>$}5.5, sulfate sorption was usually very low or negligible. Allophanic materials increased the adsorption of the nutrients, whereas organic carbon and silicate prevented the adsorption of phosphate and especially of sulfate. When the anions were added as a mixture, sulfate adsorption was drastically decreased even in the presence of low amounts of phosphate (initial phosphate/sulfate molar ratio (R){$\ll$}1). A possible explanation of these findings is that phosphate adsorption on soil samples decreased their surface charge and point of zero charge (PZC), preventing the fixation of sulfate ions on more negative surfaces. Finally, pH strongly influenced the competition in adsorption between phosphate and sulfate; at pH values {$<$}4.5 sulfate competed with phosphate, probably forming inner-sphere complexes, and was able to replace some phosphate anions previously adsorbed on the surfaces of soil samples.},

  abstract = {Globally, phosphorus (P) limits productivity of trees in many forests and plantations especially in highly weathered, acidic or calcareous profiles. Most trees form mycorrhizal associations which are prevalent in the organic and mineral soil horizons. This review critically examines mechanisms that enhance the acquisition of P by tree roots. Mycorrhizal roots have a greater capacity to take up phosphate (Pi) from the soil solution than non-mycorrhizal root tips. Factors that contribute to this include the extent of extraradical hyphal penetration of soil and the physiology and biochemistry of the fungal/soil and fungal/plant interfaces. Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) trees are likely to benefit from association with basidiomycetes that possess several high-affinity Pi transporters that are expressed in extraradical hyphae and whose expression is enhanced by P deficiency. To understand fully the role of these putative transporters in the symbiosis, data regarding their localization, Pi transport capacities and regulation are required. Some ECM fungi are able to effect release of Pi from insoluble mineral P through excretion of low-molecular-weight organic anions such as oxalate, but the relative contribution of insoluble P dissolution in situ remains to be quantified. How the production of oxalate is regulated by nitrogen remains a key question to be answered. Lastly, phosphatase release from mycorrhizas is likely to play a significant role in the acquisition of Pi from labile organic forms of P (Po). As labile forms of Po can constitute the major fraction of the total P in some tropical and temperate soils, a greater understanding of the forms of Po available to the phosphatases is warranted.},

  abstract = {Maintaining, and if possible increasing, soil fertility is a major goal for sustainable forest management, because it determines to a large extent the site's capacity for wood production. As, generally, forest soils are poor, and the demand for wood is still increasing, the boundary of resilience of each ecosystem must be known. Several cases must be identified: the case of natural or native species forests, either planted or not, which are extensively managed and the case of intensively managed plantations. In this paper, input\textendash output budgets are calculated according to temporal and spatial scales. The measurement of the main inputs and outputs is discussed. When all the fluxes entering and leaving the selected compartment are measured, the budget provides a realistic picture of the direction of change in soil fertility. In other cases, the validity of the budget has to be considered according to the proposed hypothesis. A balanced budget means that the element considered is not depleted from the soil. This does not mean that no changes occur in the ecosystem. A positive budget means that the element considered is accumulating in the system, which is not always favorable. A negative budget means the element considered is depleted in the system, but it has to be related to the available soil reserves and to the rate of flux into available pool to be a real index of risk for the ecosystem. Information from several case studies shows the interest of these budgets because (i) they are able to characterize depletion before the direct analysis of the system would be able to indicate it, and (ii) they give useful quantitative data for recommendations applicable to forest management. These budgets have the disadvantage of being labor-intensive and expensive. They are also site-specific and give little direct information for identifying the mechanisms of nutrient tranformations within the ecosystem. The relationships between forest production and nutrient availability are not sufficiently known to be able to quantify the variation in production when nutrient depletion is observed. On account of the difficulty in calculating such a budget, the most efficient strategy could be the following: (i) calculate budgets in a representative network of sites; (ii) relate the individual budgets to more easily available parameters; and (iii) propose more simple indicators for managers. Land classification and the potential impact of forest management is required for giving appropriate recommendations to managers.},

The effects of atmospheric deposition of pollutant sulfate on soils is a similar problem and should alter cation distributions between solutions and exchange sites in predictable ways. The consequences of sulfate deposition are potentially serious: displacement of greater concentrations of exchangeable Al, Ca, and Mg (polyvalent cations) into soil solutions, and long-term depletions of exchangeable nutrient cations, for example, Ca and Mg, in highly weathered soils with limited mineral weathering rates.},

Forest soil data are notably absent, however, that describe sustained nutrient supply of nutrient depletion. The objective of this study was to evaluate how exchangeable nutrient cations of a previously cultivated Ultisol responded to the first three decades of pine forest development. On six occasions during the three decades, the upper 0.6 m of soil was sampled from eight permanent plots and chemically analyzed with the same procedures. During this period, KCl-exchangeable acidity (as positive charges of adsorbed H and Al ions) increased by 37.3 kmol"c/ha in the upper 0.6 m of soil and positive charges of exchangeable Ca and Mg were depleted by 34.8 and 8.9 kmol"c/ha (by 696 and 108 kg/ha), whereas, exchangeable K was reduced by only 0.5 kmol"c/ha (19 kg/ha). Depletion of soil exchangeable Ca was on the same order of magnitude as Ca removals (i.e., Ca accumulation in biomass and forest floor plus that lost in soil leaching). Removals of soil Mg also appeared to outpace resupply from recycling, atmospheric deposition, and mineral weathering, but not the same degree as Ca. Over the three decades, soil leaching loss of these divalent cations (from 0.6 m depth) appeared equal to cation accumulation in biomass plus forest floor, with sulfate balancing about half these cations in leachates. In contrast to Ca and Mg, total K removals from the soil exceeded reductions in soil exchangeable K by nearly 20-fold. Exchangeable K was well buffered in surface mineral soils apparently due to a combination of biological recycling via leaching of canopies and forest floor plus mineral weathering release. These nutrient dynamics may be common to many nutrient-demanding forest ecosystems supported by soils with low activity kandic or oxic horizons. Such soils (Ultisols and Oxisols) occur on many hundreds of millions of hectares in temperate and tropical zones.},

Competing vegetation clearly affects the availability of site resources such as soil moisture and nutrients. Harvest residues can also impact the availability of site resources. We examined second- and third-year seedling performance of a Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) plantation with different vegetation control and biomass retention treatments on a highly productive site in the coast range of Washington. Treatments included a bole-only harvest without vegetation control (BO-VC), a bole-only harvest with complete vegetation control (BO+VC), and a total tree harvest with complete vegetation control that also included removal of all coarse woody debris and harvest residues (TTP+VC). The objectives of the study were to determine if vegetation control and residue retention treatments affected soil moisture, soil temperature, and apparent nitrogen (N) availability, and whether these differences in site resources were correlated with seedling size and growth. In both the second and third growing seasons, volumetric soil moisture at 0\textendash 20cm depth was lowest on plots that did not receive vegetation control (BO-VC). Seedlings on these plots also had the lowest diameter and volume growth. In year 2, which was fairly moist, volume growth on TTP+VC plots was slightly higher than on BO+VC plots. TTP+VC plots did have lower soil moisture, but soil temperatures were slightly warmer. In year 3, a drier year, growth was greatest on BO+VC plots, which had consistently higher soil moisture levels. Apparent N availability in year 3 also varied with vegetation control. Douglas-fir foliar N concentrations averaged 2.3\% on the plots where competing vegetation was eliminated, compared to 1.8\% on plots where competing vegetation was not controlled. Douglas-fir foliar N concentrations did not differ between residue retention treatments, although N concentrations of competing vegetation were higher where residual biomass was retained. Higher apparent N availability was correlated with greater seedling growth. Based on results from years 2 and 3, it appears that soil moisture, particularly late in the growing season, had the greatest effect on seedling growth in both years. Available N may also have played a role, although the effects of N cannot be completely separated from those of soil moisture. When soil moisture is adequate, it appears that available N and soil temperature exert greater influence on growth. Vegetation control and residue retention can influence all three of these factors. The relative importance of each factor may depend on the year-to-year variation in environmental conditions.},

In general, homogeneity of the litter increased as fresh litter of different initial chemistries was transformed into chemically more uniform soil organic matter. Ecosystem budgets indicated that after 57 mo of decay, litter had lost 63\% of its original mass and had released C (65\%),N (17\%), P (79\%), Ca (50\%), Mg (80\%), and Mn (74\%), and had accumulated Al (431\%) and Fe (353\%). Evidence is presented indicating that the retention of Al (and Fe) is primarily controlled by abiotic adsorption onto litter exchanges sites. Overall results are consistent with a two\textemdash phase model of decay: in the first phase (0 to 3\textemdash 4 yr), mass loss fits a negative exponential model of decay, an inverse linear relationship exists between N concentration and mass loss, and rapid changes are observed in litter chemistry; the second phase (3\textemdash 4+ yr) is characterized by markedly slower changes in mass loss and litter chemistry.},

  abstract = {New Zealand law requires sustainable forest management. International definitions of sustainability typically include maintaining the productive capacity of forest soils, and decision tools are needed for managing harvesting and site preparation practices. Trials were established between 1986 and 1994 in different physiographic regions of New Zealand to determine the effects of management on the second-rotation performance of Pinus radiata. Main harvesting and residue treatments at three North Island sites include: whole-tree harvest plus forest floor removal, whole-tree harvest, and stem-only harvest retaining a single layer of slash. These treatments were installed in a random block split-plot design (with and without fertiliser). Additional treatments were added at specific sites (e.g., double slash addition at Woodhill; topsoil removal at Tarawera) to test hypotheses that harvesting intensity is negatively correlated with second-rotation growth, that inadequate nutrition is the reason for the negative correlation, and that fertiliser additions can compensate for the negative impact of harvesting on nutrition. Stands were thinned-to-waste to reduce stocking by 50\% at Woodhill (age 7 years), Tarawera and Kinleith (age 5 years). On recent coastal sand dunes at Woodhill, foliar analyses suggest that nutrient availability to trees of N, P, K, B, Mn, and Zn were reduced during critical periods of stand establishment by forest floor removal, and improved by retention of thinning slash. Diameter at 5 years declined as forest floor C:N ratio increased. Diameter after 11 years was reduced by forest floor removal, and positively related with residue retention. On approximately 100-year-old basaltic tephra gravel at Tarawera, foliar concentrations of K and B were positively related with slash and soil nutrient retention, however, the effect of harvest removals on tree nutrition and growth was substantially less than observed on recent sand dunes due to greater native fertility of basaltic gravel. Forest floor C:N ratio at Tarawera explained less variation in tree growth than at Woodhill. On the N-rich Taupo sandy loam of Kinleith Forest, there was no correlation between forest floor C:N ratio and tree diameter to age 5 years. Fertiliser additions have increased tree diameter at all sites, and can ameliorate harvesting-related reductions in growth. However, fertiliser additions caused significant reductions in foliar concentrations of most nutrients studied except N. These trials have been useful for identifying the benefits of residue retention among sites with varying levels of native fertility. Based on the results of this study, we recommend organic matter retention during harvest and site preparation on N-deficient sites such as Pinaki Typic Sandy Recent Soil.},

  abstract = {Ectomycorrhizal (EcM) fungi are increasingly recognized as important agents of mineral weathering and soil development, with far-reaching impacts on biogeochemical cycles. Because EcM fungi live in a symbiotic relationship with trees and in close contact with bacteria and archaea, it is difficult to distinguish between the weathering effects of the fungus, host tree and other micro-organisms. Here, we quantified mineral weathering by the fungus Paxillus involutus, growing in symbiosis with Pinus sylvestris under sterile conditions. The mycorrhizal trees were grown in specially designed sterile microcosms in which the supply of soluble phosphorus (P) in the bulk media was varied and grains of the calcium phosphate mineral apatite mixed with quartz, or quartz alone, were provided in plastic wells that were only accessed by their fungal partner. Under P limitation, pulse labelling of plants with 14CO2 revealed plant-to-fungus allocation of photosynthates, with 17 times more 14C transferred into the apatite wells compared with wells with only quartz. Fungal colonization increased the release of P from apatite by almost a factor of three, from 7.5 ({$\pm$}1.1) \texttimes{} 10-10 mol m-2 s-1 to 2.2 ({$\pm$}0.52) \texttimes{} 10-9 mol m-2 s-1. On increasing the P supply in the microcosms from no added P, through apatite alone, to both apatite and orthophosphate, the proportion of biomass in roots progressively increased at the expense of the fungus. These three observations, (i) proportionately more plant energy investment in the fungal partner under P limitation, (ii) preferential fungal transport of photosynthate-derived carbon towards patches of apatite grains and (iii) fungal enhancement of weathering rate, reveal the tightly coupled plant\textendash fungal interactions underpinning enhanced EcM weathering of apatite and its utilization as P source.},

  abstract = {Information on primary production, decomposition, hydrology, and element cycling was integrated in annual budgets of accumulation and flux among components of a mature Douglas-fir forest ecosystem. Annual N input in precipitation and dust was 2.0 kg/ha, and an estimated 2.8 kg/ha were fixed by cyanophycophilous lichens in the canopy. Annual N loss to groundwater was 1.5 kg/ha. N appeared to be accumulating in the ecosystem. An annual decrease of \textasciitilde{} 2.8 kg/ha in vegetation was offset by estimated increases of 5.0 kg/ha in fallen logs, and 2.8 kg/ha in soil organic matter. Microparticulate litterfall provided a large input of N to the forest floor (3.3 kg@?ha\^-\^1@?yr\^-\^1). Annual input of metallic cations in precipitation was only 545 eq/ha, whereas weathering input (net release of cations to solution from primary and secondary minerals) was estimated by difference at @?9000 eq/ha. Total annual loss to groundwater was 9400 eq/ha and, because of little cation accumulation, loss almost exactly balanced input. Net transfers of P were small. Total annual input was 0.5 kg/ha, total loss was 0.7 kg/ha, and net accumulation was -0.2 kg/ha. Input of elements in precipitation and dryfall was small compared with that in the eastern United States. Water chemistry profiles showed that the biologically important elements N, P, and K increased in concentration as water passed through the canopy and litter layer but decreased as water passed through the rooted part of the mineral soil. In contrast, Na increased by a factor of 20 as water passed through the rooted soil. Concentrations of all elements except Mg were lower in the stream water than in solution at 2.0-m depth in the subsoil. At our site, unlike some eastern forests, Kjeldahl N (organic N plus NH"4\^+) accounted for most of the measured N in solution. Nitrate levels were low, averaging @{$<$}20 @mg/L NO"3\^--N at all points in the profile. Titratable alkalinity dominated anion chemistry in the mineral soil, but in the upper parts of the water chemistry profile (precipitation, throughfall, and litter leachate) Cl\^- and SO"4\^= together accounted for 30-40\% of the negative charge. Total return to the forest floor in litterfall was greater than that reported for other Douglas-fir stands mainly because of plentiful microparticulate forms and coarse woody debris. Leaf fall accounted for less than half of the total litterfall input of N to the forest floor. Element accumulations in coarse woody debris almost cancelled the negative net annual increments in the living vegetation compartments. Overall cycling patterns show that only the biologically limiting element, N, was tightly conserved. For other elements, losses nearly equaled or even exceeded inputs. Redistribution from old to new foliage was also more important for N, P, and K than for Ca, Mg, and Na. Solution transport processes were important for all elements and dominated the cycling patterns of biologically less important elements such as Ca and Na. Vegetation absorbed metallic cations mainly from the mineral soil. However, much N and P were absorbed by roots penetrating up to or into the litter layer. Fluxes of hydrogen ions (H\^+) resulting from water flow were negligible (@{$<$}10\^2 eq@?ha\^-\^1@?yr\^-\^1) compared with H\^+ release during carbonic acid dissociation and H\^+ removal accompanying cation release in weathering (both @?10\^4 eq@?ha\^-\^1@?yr\^-\^1). Uptake of metallic cations by vegetation and release during decomposition exceeded uptake and release of sulfur and phosphorus anions, resulting in a net H\^+ flux of @?3 x 10\^3 eq@?ha\^-\^1@?yr\^-\^1. An increase in acidity of the rainfall to pH 4.0 would increase H\^+ input only @?3 x 10\^2 eq@?ha\^-\^1@?yr\^-\^1.},

The data required for model application can be operationally determined on soil samples, making the model generally applicable and independent of any type of calibration. The model considers the contribution to the weathering rate from 12 groups of the most common primary and secondary minerals of soils, reacting in separate reactions with H+-ion, H2O, CO2 and organic acids expressed as dissolved organic carbon (DOC). The weathering rate sub-model couples the effects of dissolved Al and base cations on the reaction mechanisms. The model takes into account changes in soil temperature, different chemical conditions, the effect of vegetation interactions with the soil and N transformations. The kinetic coefficients and reaction orders are based on a complete re-evaluation of weathering data available in the literature, and additional kinetic data determined by the authors. Data from 23 different independent determinations of the field weathering rate from 15 sites in Scandinavia, Central Europe and North America were compiled and used to verify the model. The model is capable of estimating the release rate of base cations due to chemical weathering from information on soil mineralogy, texture and geochemical properties of the order of {$\pm$}20\% of the rate determined by independent methods. The results indicate that small amounts of dark minerals like epidote and hornblende, and the plagioclase content, largely determine the field weathering rate.},

Thus it became the obvious parameter to use for tuning the models, since the real value was unknown. This is not true. New models such as SAFE and PROFILE have made possible modeling of weathering rates in the field from geochemical and geophysical properties. The weathering model in PROFILE is a reductionistic type of model, where the main mechanism is based on a set of parallel molecular mechanisms at the mineral surface. Rate coefficients in the models have been taken from laboratory studies. In field tests, the PROFILE model has performed well and is capable of predicting the weathering rate well within the range determined by other methods. PROFILE is operationally used for regional weathering rate mapping and is currently applied in 37 countries. Through feedback mechanisms in the model, the weathering rate can be used to affect biotic processes.},

However, in deeper soil layers and in groundwater systems, it appears to overestimate weathering rates. This overestimation has been corrected by improving the kinetic expression describing mineral dissolution by adding or upgrading `breaking functions'. The base cation and aluminium brakes have been strengthened, and an additional silicate brake has been developed, improving the ability to describe mineral-water reactions in deeper soils. These brakes are developed from a molecular-level model of the dissolution mechanisms. Equations, parameters and constants describing mineral dissolution kinetics have now been obtained for 102 different minerals from 12 major structural groups, comprising all types of minerals encountered in most soils. The PROFILE and ForSAFE weathering sub-model was extended to cover two-dimensional catchments, both in the vertical and the horizontal direction, including the hydrology. Comparisons between this improved model and field observations is available in Erlandsson Lampa et al. (2019, This special issue). The results showed that the incorporation of a braking effect of silica concentrations was necessary and helps obtain more accurate descriptions of soil evolution rates at greater depths and within the saturated zone.},

Few of these studies are in forested areas of greatest ecological concern, and many of the sites are not investigating the influence of air pollution stress on the long-term productivity and biogeochemistry of forest stands. Moreover, most sites were not originally selected with the intent of comparing patterns of ozone concentrations among a variety of forest stands that differ in climate, air quality, vegetation cover, and elevation.

During the winter of 1981\textendash 82, one was whole-tree clearcut, one was commercially thinned, and one was designated as the untreated reference. Before treatment, living and dead biomass and soil on the whole-tree clearcut site contained 578 Mg ha-1 organic matter, 5 Mg ha-1 nitrogen, 1 Mg ha-1 phosphorus, 5 Mg ha-1 potassium, 4 Mg ha-1 calcium, and 13 Mg ha-1 magnesium. An estimated 158 Mg ha-1 (27\% of total organic matter) were removed during the whole-tree harvest. Calcium appeared to be the nutrient most susceptible to depletion with 13\% of total site Ca removed in whole-tree clearcut products. In contrast, only 4\% (16 Mg ha-1) of the total organic matter and {$\leqslant$}2\% of the total nutrients were removed from the thinned site. Partial cuts appear to be a reliable management option, in general, for minimizing nutrient depletion and maximizing long-term productivity of central hardwood sites.

We tested the ability of NutsFor to reproduce major element and stable isotope tracer (26Mg and 44Ca) cycling with the data from 35-yr old beech stand in France. NutsFor correctly reproduced the measured trends in soil solution chemistry for most major elements. The high similarity between modeled and measured distribution of 26Mg and 44Ca tracers in the ecosystem provided a unique and robust way to evaluate the hypotheses grounding the model and study the efficiency of Mg and Ca cycling at this very nutrient-poor site.},

  abstract = {Long-term patterns in nutrient cycling in regrowing Douglas-fir (Pseudosuga menziesii Mirb. Franco) and red alder (Alnus rubra Bong.) on native soils plus soils previously occupied by other species were simulated using the nutrient cycling model. Simulations of regrowing stands were also compared with observations of nutrient cycling in mature Douglas-fir and red alder. We hypothesized that (1) prolonged presence of red alder will cause a depletion in soil base cations due to increased nitrification and NO3- leaching; (2) lower base cation availability under red alder will ultimately cause biomass production to decline; (3) high N availability in red alder soils will favor regrowth of Douglas-fir; (4) higher base cation and P status of the Douglas-fir soils will favor growth of red alder both in the short- and long-term, since N is not limiting to red alder; and (5) in regrowing red alder, NO3- leaching will increase with time as a result of increased N fixation. All hypotheses were confirmed, but the effect of soil type on biomass production was minimal both for red alder and Douglas-fir. The higher soil organic matter content in the mature red alder stand most likely reflected previous occupation by old-growth Douglas-fir and also a large litter input from the understory vegetation. In general, the nutrient cycling model simulated differences in nutrient cycling patterns at least qualitatively between Douglas-fir and red alder and was helpful in identifying potential gaps in the understanding of biogeochemical cycling as well as uncertainties in the data. The nutrient cycling model did not fully elucidate differences in P cycling between Douglas-fir and red alder and overestimated weathering rates under Douglas-fir. Uncertainties in the data included: (1) temporal patterns in N fixation in the regrowing stands; (2) understory litterfall; and (3) site history and, consequently, presence of pre-existing differences in site conditions.},

In general, lowland tropical forests have more nitrogen and lower dry mass/nitrogen ratios in litterfall than most temperate forests, while nitrogen return in montane tropical forests is comparable to that in temperate forests. Calcium return is also high in most tropical forests studied, but many tropical forests (lowland and montane) have little phosphorus return and very high dry mass/phosphorus ratios in litterfall compared to most temperate forests. Phosphorus appears to be cycled highly efficiently in such forests. Fine litterfall in the range of tropical forests studied was predicted from climate, and the residuals of this regression were positively correlated with phosphorus but not nitrogen concentrations in litterfall. The amount of fine litterfall (uncorrected for climate) was also significantly correlated with phosphorus concentrations in moist and wet lowland tropical forests. These analyses suggest that phosphorus but not nitrogen availability limits litterfall in a substantial subset of intact tropical forests. Sites on old oxisols and ultisols, especially those in Amazonia, appear to be particularly low in available phosphorus.},

To determine nutrient outputs, estimates of soil water flux had to be coupled with nutrient concentrations in soil lysimeters. However, only a few IFS sites had direct measures of soil water flux (e.g., gaged watersheds at Coweeta and Turkey Lakes), and even in these instances, water flux measurements were not directly comparable with water flux below the lowest lysimeter location. Thus, our purpose was to provide water flux estimates corresponding to lysimeter locations for the IFS sites. We used the hydrologic simulation model, PROSPER (Goldstein et al. 1974), to estimate evapotranspiration and soil water flux for several IFS study sites. A modeling approach was used because it was impractical to measure soil water flux at each site. While other hydrologic models were available (e.g., BROOK; Federer and Nash 1978), we chose PROSPER because it had been applied successfully in both hardwood and conifer forests at Coweeta (Swift et al. 1975; Huff and Swank 1985) and performed well in regional evapotranspiration assessments (USDA 1980).},

  abstract = {Sources of variation in leaf area index (LAI; m2 of projected leaf area per m2 of ground area) and its seasonal dynamics are not well known in managed Douglas-fir stands, despite the importance of leaf area in forecasting forest growth, particularly in stands impacted by insects or disease. The influence of Swiss needle cast (SNC) on coastal Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii [Mirb] Franco) LAI and litterfall dynamics was quantified by destructively sampling 122 stems from 36 different permanent plots throughout north coastal Oregon, USA, and by monitoring litterfall for 3 years in 15 of these plots. LAI, total annual litterfall, and the seasonal distribution of foliage and fine woody litterfall were all influenced by stand structural attributes, physiographic features, and SNC severity. Mean LAI in this study was 5.44 {$\pm$} 2.16. The relatively low LAIs were attributed primarily to the effects of SNC on foliage retention, and secondarily to its direct measurement by hierarchical foliage sampling in contrast to indirect measurement by light interception or tree allometry. For a given stand structure and SNC severity, LAI was 36\% greater in the fall after current year foliage was fully developed and older aged classes had not yet senesced. Annual litterfall expressed as a proportion of LAI at the start of the growing season varied from 0.13 to 0.53 and declined with increasing initial LAI. SNC also shifted more of the annual foliage litterfall to earlier in the spring. Fine woody litterfall experienced a different seasonal shift as the peak occurred later in the year on sites with high SNC, but this only occurred on northerly aspects. Defoliation from the endemic SNC pathogen can drastically reduce LAI and change both total and seasonal foliage litterfall patterns.},

This harvest removed 50 kg P/ha, five times more P than the bole-only clearcut of an adjacent watershed. The P content of branches and twigs was nearly twice that of stem wood and bark, which contributed to the intensity of P removal. The amount of P removed in harvest was small compared to total P in the mineral soil (1600 kg/ha) but large compared to the pools of P in the living vegetation (70 kg/ha) and the forest floor (85 kg/ha). Negligible P was lost in streamwater and sediment (0.2 kg P/ha over 3 years), although export of other nutrients increased dramatically. Although leaching of P from the forest floor to the mineral soil in the first 2 years after logging was higher in harvested sites than in undisturbed forest, the increase in P leaching (0.7 kg P/(ha yr)) was much less than the estimated decrease in P uptake from the forest floor (4.8 kg/(ha yr)), suggesting a 70\% decline in net P mineralization in the forest floor. Even in areas where P uptake by regrowing vegetation was quite high, calculated net P mineralization was 40\% lower in the first 2 years of growth than in the undisturbed forest. Revegetation was rapid: in the first 2 years after logging, P in biomass had accumulated to 3\% of the uncut forest; uptake was 12\% of that in the uncut forest. Whether intensive biomass removals could induce P deficiency in future rotations is unknown.},

Portland, OR: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station. 18 p. Live tree biomass estimates are essential for carbon accounting, bioenergy feasibility studies, and other analyses. Several models are currently used for estimating tree biomass. Each of these incorporates different calculation methods that may significantly impact the estimates of total aboveground tree biomass, merchantable biomass, and carbon pools. Consequently, carbon markets, bioenergy projects, and similar efforts may be affected. In addition to differences in allometric equations, the various methods are most suitable for particular geographic scales of analysis. We examine three approaches that might be used for midscale analyses (e.g., 25,000 to several million acres) and compare the regional models with equations developed by Jenkins et al. and with the component ratio method (CRM). These three methods produce relatively similar estimates of total aboveground biomass for softwood species in Oregon, but substantially different estimates for the proportion of total biomass that is merchantable. For the major softwood species in Oregon, the total aboveground biomass using the CRM is 3 percent lower than estimates with regional equations, and the Jenkins models produce estimates that are 17 percent higher. However, on average, the proportion of softwood merchantable biomass computed with CRM is about 83 percent of the total aboveground biomass with little variation from species to species, whereas regional models estimate that 72 percent is merchantable, and the Jenkins equations estimate that 78 percent is merchantable.},

The authors were able to calibrate the model with existing data. The model simulated observed monthly leaching reasonably well. The r2-values of model simulations compared with field observations of monthly leaching of NO3-\_N, NH4+\_N, Ca, Mg, and K were 0.78, 0.7, 0.78, 0.84, and 0.75, respectively. Modeled multi-year cumulative leaching of NO3-\_N, NH4+\_N, Ca, Mg, and K compared with actual values gave r2-values close to one for all cases considered. The results also showed that soil nutrient leaching had increased approximately five-fold for NO3-\_N, 80\% for NH4+\_N, 71\% for K, 20\% for Ca, and 14\% for Mg during the 3 years following a stem-only harvest operation applied watershed-wide. However, the model simulation showed that increased nutrient leaching during the 11 years following the stem-only harvest was small compared with the amounts removed in the biomass during the harvest. Increased nutrient leaching following harvesting did not appear to impact site productivity over the long term.},
