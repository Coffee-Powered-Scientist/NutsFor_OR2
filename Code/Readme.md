**Code folder Organization**

The Hiearchy of the code file follows the following sturcture:

Code Folder: Stores the LN_SED, LN_BAS, HN_BAS, and HN_SED sub folders. Within each sub folder are codes tailored for each site. 

In the open code folder are the Calibration_Site R scripts, these scripts are called upon by the core Readme file in the head of the repository 

(Project_Master->Test_Rep->Readme)
