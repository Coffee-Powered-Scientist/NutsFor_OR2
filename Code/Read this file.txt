Files within the named sub folder within "Code" store site-specific code; all these codes are the same 
(as the analysis and calibrative steps require the same meaurements and calculations).

"Mutator.R" files mutate datasets, splicing them together and outputting new csv's to the "Edited Data" folder. 

"Grapher.R" files use ggplot2 package to graph data in edited data. 

"Calibration_SiteType" Codes source all code for a given site, they should be all that is necesary to run the code and gather results to completion.
