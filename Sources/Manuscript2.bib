  abstract = {Elements such as Ca, Mg, and K, which are required for plant growth, are important components of the nutrient cycle in forested ecosystems, and by far the largest store of these elements in North American and European forests is within the minerals constituting the forest soil. Although external inputs from the atmosphere in both the dissolved and particulate load can provide a portion of these elements to a growing forest, the ultimate source of most inorganic elemental nutrients is provided through cation exchange and mineral weathering reactions that take place in the soil profile. Mineral inventories and determinations of the physical characteristics, mineralogy and chemistry of soil components, and mineral weathering reactions that occur in soils must be an integral part of any study that attempts to document the nutrient status of a forested ecosystem.},

As required plant and microbial nutrients, N, P, and S are taken up by organisms, incorporated into organic matter, and released from the organic matter during decomposition. Therefore, the distribution and cycling of these nutrients can be closely related. However, the quantitative relationships between these elements in vegetation, as expressed by nutrient ratios (N:P and N:S), vary within trees and between biomes (Vitousek et al. 1988). Accumulation of organic matter and associated N and S in soil over long time periods can be strongly influenced by P dynamics (McGill and Christie 1983). Over shorter periods, stabilization and mineralization of organic N and P in soil are controlled by different factors; the control of organic S may be similar to N or P, depending on its chemical form (McGill and Cole 1981).},

  abstract = {Nitrogen (N) is a key nutrient that shapes cycles of other essential elements in forests, including calcium (Ca). When N availability exceeds ecosystem demands, excess N can stimulate Ca leaching and deplete Ca from soils. Over the long term, these processes may alter the proportion of available Ca that is derived from atmospheric deposition vs. bedrock weathering, which has fundamental consequences for ecosystem properties and nutrient supply. We evaluated how landscape variation in soil N, reflecting long-term legacies of biological N fixation, influenced plant and soil Ca availability and ecosystem Ca sources across 22 temperate forests in Oregon. We also examined interactions between soil N and bedrock Ca using soil N gradients on contrasting basaltic vs. sedimentary bedrock that differed 17-fold in underlying Ca content. We found that low-N forests on Ca-rich basaltic bedrock relied strongly on Ca from weathering, but that soil N enrichment depleted readily weatherable mineral Ca and shifted forest reliance toward atmospheric Ca. Forests on Ca-poor sedimentary bedrock relied more consistently on atmospheric Ca across all levels of soil N enrichment. The broad importance of atmospheric Ca was unexpected given active regional uplift and erosion that are thought to rejuvenate weathering supply of soil minerals. Despite different Ca sources to forests on basaltic vs. sedimentary bedrock, we observed consistent declines in plant and soil Ca availability with increasing N, regardless of the Ca content of underlying bedrock. Thus, traditional measures of Ca availability in foliage and soil exchangeable pools may poorly reflect long-term Ca sources that sustain soil fertility. We conclude that long-term soil N enrichment can deplete available Ca and cause forests to rely increasingly on Ca from atmospheric deposition, which may limit ecosystem Ca supply in an increasingly N-rich world.},

  abstract = {The cycles of base cations differ from those of N, P, and S in several important respects. Inorganically driven processes such as weathering, cation exchange, and soil leaching are often considerably more important in base cation cycles than in the cycles of N, P, and S, whereas organic processes such as heterotrophic immobilization and oxidation are typically less important (Figure 8.1). The fact that Ca, K, and Mg exist primarily as cations in solution whereas N, P, and S exist primarily as anions has major implications for the cycling of these nutrients and the effects of acid deposition upon these cycles. The introduction of H+, whether by atmospheric deposition or by internal processes, will directly impact the fluxes of Ca, K, and Mg via cation exchange or weathering processes. Thus, soil leaching is often of major importance in cation cycles, and many forest ecosystems show a net loss of base cations (in contrast to net gains of N and P; Cole and Rapp 1981).},

  abstract = {Wide natural gradients of soil nitrogen (N) can be used to examine fundamental relationships between plant\textendash soil\textendash microbial N cycling and hydrologic N loss, and to test N-saturation theory as a general framework for understanding ecosystem N dynamics. We characterized plant production, N uptake and return in litterfall, soil gross and net N mineralization rates, and hydrologic N losses of nine Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) forests across a wide soil N gradient in the Oregon Coast Range (USA). Surface mineral soil N (0\textendash 10 cm) ranged nearly three-fold from 0.29\% to 0.78\% N, and in contrast to predictions of N-saturation theory, was linearly related to 10-fold variation in net N mineralization, from 8 to 82 kg N{$\cdot$}ha-1{$\cdot$}yr-1. Net N mineralization was unrelated to soil C:N, soil texture, precipitation, and temperature differences among sites. Net nitrification was negatively related to soil pH, and accounted for {$<$}20\% of net N mineralization at low-N sites, increasing to 85\textendash 100\% of net N mineralization at intermediate- and high-N sites. The ratio of net : gross N mineralization and nitrification increased along the gradient, indicating progressive saturation of microbial N demands at high soil N. Aboveground N uptake by plants increased asymptotically with net N mineralization to a peak of {$\sim$}35 kg N{$\cdot$}ha-1{$\cdot$}yr-1. Aboveground net primary production per unit net N mineralization varied inversely with soil N, suggesting progressive saturation of plant N demands at high soil N. Hydrologic N losses were dominated by dissolved organic N at low-N sites, with increased nitrate loss causing a shift to dominance by nitrate at high-N sites, particularly where net nitrification exceeded plant N demands. With the exception of N mineralization patterns, our results broadly support the application of the N-saturation model developed from studies of anthropogenic N deposition to understand N cycling and saturation of plant and microbial sinks along natural soil N gradients. This convergence of behavior in unpolluted and polluted forest N cycles suggests that where future reductions in deposition to polluted sites do occur, symptoms of N saturation are most likely to persist where soil N content remains elevated.},

  abstract = {Maintaining, and if possible increasing, soil fertility is a major goal for sustainable forest management, because it determines to a large extent the site's capacity for wood production. As, generally, forest soils are poor, and the demand for wood is still increasing, the boundary of resilience of each ecosystem must be known. Several cases must be identified: the case of natural or native species forests, either planted or not, which are extensively managed and the case of intensively managed plantations. In this paper, input\textendash output budgets are calculated according to temporal and spatial scales. The measurement of the main inputs and outputs is discussed. When all the fluxes entering and leaving the selected compartment are measured, the budget provides a realistic picture of the direction of change in soil fertility. In other cases, the validity of the budget has to be considered according to the proposed hypothesis. A balanced budget means that the element considered is not depleted from the soil. This does not mean that no changes occur in the ecosystem. A positive budget means that the element considered is accumulating in the system, which is not always favorable. A negative budget means the element considered is depleted in the system, but it has to be related to the available soil reserves and to the rate of flux into available pool to be a real index of risk for the ecosystem. Information from several case studies shows the interest of these budgets because (i) they are able to characterize depletion before the direct analysis of the system would be able to indicate it, and (ii) they give useful quantitative data for recommendations applicable to forest management. These budgets have the disadvantage of being labor-intensive and expensive. They are also site-specific and give little direct information for identifying the mechanisms of nutrient tranformations within the ecosystem. The relationships between forest production and nutrient availability are not sufficiently known to be able to quantify the variation in production when nutrient depletion is observed. On account of the difficulty in calculating such a budget, the most efficient strategy could be the following: (i) calculate budgets in a representative network of sites; (ii) relate the individual budgets to more easily available parameters; and (iii) propose more simple indicators for managers. Land classification and the potential impact of forest management is required for giving appropriate recommendations to managers.},

The effects of atmospheric deposition of pollutant sulfate on soils is a similar problem and should alter cation distributions between solutions and exchange sites in predictable ways. The consequences of sulfate deposition are potentially serious: displacement of greater concentrations of exchangeable Al, Ca, and Mg (polyvalent cations) into soil solutions, and long-term depletions of exchangeable nutrient cations, for example, Ca and Mg, in highly weathered soils with limited mineral weathering rates.},

  abstract = {A new model for base cation release due to chemical weathering of soil minerals has been developed based on transition state theory, and included in the integrated soil chemistry model PROFILE. The data required for model application can be operationally determined on soil samples, making the model generally applicable and independent of any type of calibration. The model considers the contribution to the weathering rate from 12 groups of the most common primary and secondary minerals of soils, reacting in separate reactions with H+-ion, H2O, CO2 and organic acids expressed as dissolved organic carbon (DOC). The weathering rate sub-model couples the effects of dissolved Al and base cations on the reaction mechanisms. The model takes into account changes in soil temperature, different chemical conditions, the effect of vegetation interactions with the soil and N transformations. The kinetic coefficients and reaction orders are based on a complete re-evaluation of weathering data available in the literature, and additional kinetic data determined by the authors. Data from 23 different independent determinations of the field weathering rate from 15 sites in Scandinavia, Central Europe and North America were compiled and used to verify the model. The model is capable of estimating the release rate of base cations due to chemical weathering from information on soil mineralogy, texture and geochemical properties of the order of {$\pm$}20\% of the rate determined by independent methods. The results indicate that small amounts of dark minerals like epidote and hornblende, and the plagioclase content, largely determine the field weathering rate.},

  abstract = {Interest in characterizing patterns of tropospheric ozone in continental landscapes has increased significantly in the last decade because of the documented effects of this trace gas on both human health in urban areas and vegetation in terrestrial ecosystems (EPA 1986). More recently, concern about the responsiveness of forest ecosystems to ozone (McLaughlin 1985; Johnson and Taylor 1989) has prompted similar analyses applicable to remote, forest landscapes (Evans et al. 1983; Taylor and Norby 1985; Meagher et al. 1987; Pinkerton and Lefohn 1987; Lefohn and Pinkerton 1988; Logan 1989). Few of these studies are in forested areas of greatest ecological concern, and many of the sites are not investigating the influence of air pollution stress on the long-term productivity and biogeochemistry of forest stands. Moreover, most sites were not originally selected with the intent of comparing patterns of ozone concentrations among a variety of forest stands that differ in climate, air quality, vegetation cover, and elevation. The Integrated Forest Study (IFS) is unusual in providing an array of sites with many of these contrasting characteristics.},

  abstract = {Characterizing the nutrient cycles at the Integrated Forest Study (IFS) study sites required estimates of both nutrient inputs and nutrient outputs. To determine nutrient outputs, estimates of soil water flux had to be coupled with nutrient concentrations in soil lysimeters. However, only a few IFS sites had direct measures of soil water flux (e.g., gaged watersheds at Coweeta and Turkey Lakes), and even in these instances, water flux measurements were not directly comparable with water flux below the lowest lysimeter location. Thus, our purpose was to provide water flux estimates corresponding to lysimeter locations for the IFS sites. We used the hydrologic simulation model, PROSPER (Goldstein et al. 1974), to estimate evapotranspiration and soil water flux for several IFS study sites. A modeling approach was used because it was impractical to measure soil water flux at each site. While other hydrologic models were available (e.g., BROOK; Federer and Nash 1978), we chose PROSPER because it had been applied successfully in both hardwood and conifer forests at Coweeta (Swift et al. 1975; Huff and Swank 1985) and performed well in regional evapotranspiration assessments (USDA 1980).},

  abstract = {Sources of variation in leaf area index (LAI; m2 of projected leaf area per m2 of ground area) and its seasonal dynamics are not well known in managed Douglas-fir stands, despite the importance of leaf area in forecasting forest growth, particularly in stands impacted by insects or disease. The influence of Swiss needle cast (SNC) on coastal Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii [Mirb] Franco) LAI and litterfall dynamics was quantified by destructively sampling 122 stems from 36 different permanent plots throughout north coastal Oregon, USA, and by monitoring litterfall for 3 years in 15 of these plots. LAI, total annual litterfall, and the seasonal distribution of foliage and fine woody litterfall were all influenced by stand structural attributes, physiographic features, and SNC severity. Mean LAI in this study was 5.44 {$\pm$} 2.16. The relatively low LAIs were attributed primarily to the effects of SNC on foliage retention, and secondarily to its direct measurement by hierarchical foliage sampling in contrast to indirect measurement by light interception or tree allometry. For a given stand structure and SNC severity, LAI was 36\% greater in the fall after current year foliage was fully developed and older aged classes had not yet senesced. Annual litterfall expressed as a proportion of LAI at the start of the growing season varied from 0.13 to 0.53 and declined with increasing initial LAI. SNC also shifted more of the annual foliage litterfall to earlier in the spring. Fine woody litterfall experienced a different seasonal shift as the peak occurred later in the year on sites with high SNC, but this only occurred on northerly aspects. Defoliation from the endemic SNC pathogen can drastically reduce LAI and change both total and seasonal foliage litterfall patterns.},
