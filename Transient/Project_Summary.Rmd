## Project Progress

Recent progress on my project has been centered around the calibration of NutsFor towards the 4 base case
sites I'm representing in my work.  I first started by exploring the model, shifting its parameters and
observing outputs. I did this by writing a R program that reads NutsFor data files and visualizes them after
each model run. Once I understood how the model's parameters functioned together, I calibrated the model by
individually calibrating each sub-module within the larger model. The order of calibration was choosen based on the 
hiearchal relationship between the model's sub-systems proposed for the Nutrient Cycling Model [@munsonNuCMCodeVersion1992].
For instance, hydrology will have the most 
control over model outputs, and should therefore be calibrated first. Deposition and throughfall fluxes will
determine nutrient fluxes in the organic layers, and is calibrated second. Organic matter decomposition
and buildup will control cation and anion nutrient release rates, and is calibrated third. 
Anion concentrations can push cations off of the CEC and into solution, they thus control cation
concentrations and should be calibrated forth. Cation concentrations are dependent on all previous 4 systems, and
are calibrated last. I additionally added the N-Cycle calibration proccess. N-Cycling dynamics were placed 
before anion calibration but after SOM C calibration.

1). Hydrology

I used evaporation data for the Oregon Coast region[@safleyPart651Appendix2009], and drainage data from
[@perakisBiogeochemistryTemperateForest2011] to calibrate evapotranspiration and water leaching fluxes
in my simulated sites. I assumed the same hydrological outputs between the basalt and sedimentary sites.
I also assumed that hydrology was constant over time.

2). Through fall and Deposition

Little was known about throughfall concentrations within the range of interest. Nearby throughfall data
was confounded by site rain chemistry differences [@sollinsInternalElementCycles1980]. I instead made no
assumptions about throughfall concentrations, except for $K^+$, which is generally known to leach in high
concentrations from leaf and needle surfaces [@sollinsInternalElementCycles1980; @tukeyLeachingSubstancesPlants1970].

Similar to throughfall concentrations, little was known about Dry deposition of nutrient elements, I thus made no
assumptions about the input of nutrients from dry deposition.

|Wet deposition data was taken from the National Atmospheric Deposition Progam's wet deposition data taken for
the ALSEA OR02 site [@NationalAtmosphericDeposition2020a]. Rainfall concentrations for the years of 2005-2006 were
used for the calibration of the model, and repeated over the length of the simulation for predictive simulations.
This was necessary as NADP monitoring for the ALSEA site stopped in 2007.

```



3). Soil Organic Matter

Litter C pool and SOM C pool content was calibrated using decomposition parameters in the model. The litter 
C pool was allowed to build up over time following data from
[@coleComparisonCarbonAccumulation1995; @tarrantAccumulationOrganicMatter1963;
and 
@klopatekLitterDecompositionContrasts2008]. 
The SOM C pool was kept stable over the initial short term calibration, the idea is to keep 
SOM C stable over the entire simulation time period (~500 years). 

Once the SOM C and Litter C buildup matched observed trends and roughly aligned with
the known magnitude of C buildup, parameters were accepted.

```

4). N Cycle Calibration

The N-Cycle was calibrated by first setting nitrification rates to those 
observed in [@perakisBiogeochemistryTemperateForest2011]. 
N-release rates from the organic matter pools were then changed accordingly until soil solution concentrations
and nutrient fluxes of $NO_{3}^{-}$ and $NH_{4}^{+}$ matched those observed.

knitr::include_graphics("Images/N_Cycle.png")
```


5). Anion Calibration

Parameters controlling anion concentrations were calibrated until soil solution concentrations
of anions matched those observed in lysimeter data. This was done for sulfate, phosphate, and chloride,
organic acids ($R^-$) were not measured, the concentrations of $R^-$ were separately calibrated to balance 
ANC and pH. As a point of additional constraint, leaching fluxes of anions were observed at the
20cm and 100cm layers to ensure simulated S-losses did not exceed or go below those observed in nature.

knitr::include_graphics("Images/Anions.png")
```


6). Cation calibration

Cation Calibration is similar to anion calibration, the parameters which are changed during calibration are
the Gapon Coefficients, microbial uptake parameters, or the organic matter release factor. I used lysimeter
measured concentrations to constrain calibration of parameters, I also used lysimeter measured leaching
fluxes at 20cm and 100cm depth to constrain nutrient losses. The calibration was deemed complete when 
simulated two year monthly concentrations fell within the average range of those observed.

```



7). Final Calibration

After all sub-modules were calibrated to two years, I ran the simulation for 10 years to catch potential
unrealistic behavior of the simulation on a longer timescale. I then re-calibrated the model using the same 
workflows as pictured above until long term simulated outputs were realistic within selected bounds of
constraint. 

8). Alternative Calibration: Basalt Sites

We have no direct measurements of soil solution concentrations or fluxes for basalt sites as we do
sedimentary sites. Calibration for these sites was therefore based in the establishment of higher
level ecosystem responses, such as plant nutrient acquisition, biomass acquisition, mineral weathering fluxes,and 
exchangeable pool concentrations, as constraints on calibration. 

Initial soil solution concentrations of metallic species was approximated from basalt lysmimeter data
in [@sollinsInternalElementCycles1980] and [@hedinNutrientLossesFour2003]. I did not use these
sites to calibrate monthly or long term soil solution concentrations, as the bedrock of the Sollins
1980 site was magnesium poor and the Hedin et al., 2003 site in a tropical hydrolgical and temperature 
regime. Instead, this information was used to set selectivity coefficients for the soil. 

The same C, N, P, and S data used for the low N sedimentary site was used to calibrate the low N basalt site,
and the same for the high N sites. 

The model was then run for 2 years, and outputs were monitored for unrealistic behavior. "Unrealistic" 
behavior was determined using datasets outside of those used for calculating initial parameters. For instance,
large short term losses of nutrient cations from the exchangeable pool would be unrealistic, but long
term losses would be expected if the output flux of nutrients (leaching and uptake) exceed input fluxes
(mineral weathering and deposition) [@richterSoilChemicalChange1994].



## Learning Outcomes Progress
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, some learning outcomes will be completed through different means than those suggested 
in my Learning Outcomes.

FES 525 will be replaced by another class altogether as desired by the graduate school. 

Rather than attending a forest policy seminar to fill the policy learning outcome, I will be taking a policy class
in the spring.
