Although external inputs from the atmosphere in both the dissolved and particulate load can provide a portion of these elements to a growing forest, the ultimate source of most inorganic elemental nutrients is provided through cation exchange and mineral weathering reactions that take place in the soil profile. Mineral inventories and determinations of the physical characteristics, mineralogy and chemistry of soil components, and mineral weathering reactions that occur in soils must be an integral part of any study that attempts to document the nutrient status of a forested ecosystem.},

  abstract = {Nitrogen (N) has historically been considered the most important mineral nutrient affecting performance of saplings in transitional northern hardwood forest of eastern North America, but recent attention has focused on the role of exchangeable soil calcium. Relative limitation by these factors may be changing because of enrichment of soil N from atmospheric deposition, and concomitant depletion of soil calcium due to leaching by acidic precipitation. We conducted a fertilization experiment to determine the relative importance of calcium, other base cations, several forms of nitrogen, and aluminum toxicity for the growth of saplings in a forest in northeastern Connecticut, USA. Five broadleaved deciduous and one needle-leaved evergreen species were examined; two of the broadleaved species are most abundant on fertile soil patches, and the other four are most abundant on the more prevalent low-fertility soils. Fertilizer was applied over 3 years to naturally established plants growing across the fertility gradient, and likelihood methods were used to determine whether light-dependent growth rate was affected. Of the two species that occur most frequently on fertile soils, one species responded most strongly to calcium application, and the other to nitrate. Of the four species of poorer soils, one responded to both calcium and ammonium, and the other three showed little response to any soil factor. The results suggest that calcium and nitrogen are of equal importance in determining juvenile growth across the suite of canopy tree species in transitional northern hardwood forest. The strong response of species occurring most commonly on fertile soils is suggestive of fundamental niche differentiation mode of community organization. Ongoing processes of atmospheric nitrogen deposition and soil calcium depletion from acidic precipitation may change competitive relationships of the canopy tree community of northern hardwood forests.},

  abstract = {Nutrient-poor soils often support low-stature grasslands, savannas and shrublands where the climate is warm enough and wet enough for closed forests. Though this pattern has long been recognised, the causes are debated and poorly explored. I tested the hypothesis that forest fails to develop where the total nutrient pool is too small to construct both the foliage and the wood. I estimated potential woody biomass from the difference between soil nutrient stocks and forest foliage stocks. Nutrient stocks required for foliage were estimated from leaf tissue concentrations and foliage biomass typical of Amazon forests. Potential wood biomass was estimated from wood nutrient concentrations typical of Amazon forests. Data on soil nutrient stocks were assembled from studies from South American and African forests and savannas and from south-western Australian and south-west African heathlands. According to these calculations, estimated nutrient stocks (kg ha−1) to build a forest would need to be {$>$} = P: 20–30, K 200–350, Ca 300–600 and Mg 55–65. Many surface soil horizons from both savanna and heathland sites were below these thresholds. However when deeper soil layers were included, most soils had adequate nutrient stocks. The nutrients in shortest supply were Ca and K and not P. This study suggests that nutrient stocks are usually adequate for constructing the wood needed to build a forest, except where soils are highly leached and very shallow. The implication is that, at steady state, low nutrient stocks seldom constrain forest development. The apparent failure of low nutrient stocks to explain the missing forests on nutrient-poor soils emphasises the need for new ideas on how nutrients, alone or in combination with other factors such as fire, influence vegetation structure.},

  abstract = {Depletion of calcium from forest soils has important implications for forest productivity and health. Ca is available to fine feeder roots from a number of soil organic and mineral sources, but identifying the primary source or changes of sources in response to environmental change is problematic. We used strontium isotope and alkaline earth element concentration ratios of trees and soils to discern the record of Ca sources for red spruce at a base-poor, acid deposition-impacted watershed. We measured 87Sr/86Sr and chemical compositions of cross-sectional stemwood cores of red spruce, other spruce tissues and sequential extracts of co-located soil samples. 87Sr/86Sr and Sr/Ba ratios together provide a tracer of alkaline earth element sources that distinguishes the plant-available fraction of the shallow organic soils from those of deeper organic and mineral soils. Ca/Sr ratios proved less diagnostic, due to within-tree processes that fractionate these elements from each other. Over the growth period from 1870 to 1960, 87Sr/86Sr and Sr/Ba ratios of stemwood samples became progressively more variable and on average trended toward values that considered together are characteristic of the uppermost forest floor. In detail the stemwood chemistry revealed an episode of simultaneous enhanced uptake of all alkaline earth elements during the growth period from 1930 to 1960, coincident with reported local and regional increases in atmospheric inputs of inorganic acidity. We attribute the temporal trends in stemwood chemistry to progressive shallowing of the effective depth of alkaline earth element uptake by fine roots over this growth period, due to preferential concentration of fine roots in the upper forest floor coupled with reduced nutrient uptake by roots in the lower organic and upper mineral soils in response to acid-induced aluminum toxicity. Although both increased atmospheric deposition and selective weathering of Ca-rich minerals such as apatite provide possible alternative explanations of aspects of the observed trends, the chemical buffering capacity of the forest floor-biomass pool limits their effectiveness as causal mechanisms.},

While the importance of this “terrestrial Si filter” is generally accepted, few data exist on the pools and fluxes of Si in forest vegetation and the rate of release of Si from decomposing plant tissues. We quantified the pools and fluxes of Si through vegetation and coarse woody debris (CWD) in a northern hardwood forest ecosystem (Watershed 6, W6) at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (HBEF) in New Hampshire, USA. Previous work suggested that the decomposition of CWD may have significantly contributed to an excess of DSi reported in stream-waters following experimental deforestation of Watershed 2 (W2) at the HBEF. We found that woody biomass (wood + bark) and foliage account for approximately 65\% and 31\%, respectively, of the total Si in biomass at the HBEF. During the decay of American beech (Fagus grandifolia) boles, Si loss tracked the whole-bole mass loss, while yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis) and sugar maple (Acer saccharum) decomposition resulted in a preferential Si retention of up to 30\% after 16 yr. A power-law model for the changes in wood and bark Si concentrations during decomposition, in combination with an exponential model for whole-bole mass loss, successfully reproduced Si dynamics in decaying boles. Our data suggest that a minimum of 50\% of the DSi annually produced in the soil of a biogeochemical reference watershed (W6) derives from biogenic Si (BSi) dissolution. The major source is fresh litter, whereas only 2\% comes from the decay of CWD. Decay of tree boles could only account for 9\% of the excess DSi release observed following the experimental deforestation of W2.

  abstract = {Growth and mortality were measured at 6-year intervals in a 1,180­ acre old-growth stand in southwestern Washington. Principal tree species were Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla), P acific silver fir (Abies amabilis), western redcedar (Thuja plicata), and western white pine (Pinus monticola). The1J composed 59, 27, 6, 6, and 1\%, re­ spectively, of the total cubic volume (13,290 jr) in 1947. Gross volume growth averaged 94 jr per acre per year, and mor­ tality averaged 86 jr per acre per year. Net growth was therefore minimal, and total stand volume remained nearly constant for 36 years. Douglas-fir, which accounted for only one-third of the gross growth and nearly one-half of the mortality, is losing dominance to western hemlock, which pro­ vided nearly one-half the gross growth and only 28\% of the mortality. Pacific silver fir increased in importance in the lower canopy and composed 60\% of the in­ growth. Thus, although net gain in timber volume was nil, substantial changes oc­ curred in stand characteristics during the 1947-1983 period.},

  abstract = {Calcium (Ca) is an important element for neutralizing soil acidity in temperate forests. The immediate availability of Ca in forested acid soils is largely dependent on mineralization of organic Ca, which may differ significantly among tree species. I estimated net Ca mineralization in the forest floor and upper 15cm of mineral soil beneath six tree species in a mixed-species forest in northwestern Connecticut, using the buried bag method. Net Ca mineralization in the forest floor was significantly correlated with mass loss of the decomposing forest floor litter. Higher mass loss fractions during the summer and in forest floors beneath sugar maple (Acer saccharum) and white ash (Fraxinus americana) coincided with higher net Ca mineralization rates. More Ca was released per unit mass loss of forest floor beneath sugar maple and white ash (362 and 390mmolkg−1, respectively) than beneath American beech (Fagus grandifolia), red maple (Acer rubrum), red oak (Quercus rubra) and hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) (183, 133, 147, and 190mmolkg−1, respectively). Due to the high forest floor mass beneath red maple, beech, red oak, and hemlock, net Ca mineralization in the forest floor per unit area beneath these tree species did not differ significantly from sugar maple and white ash (ranging between 80mmolm−2 per year for beech and 141mmolm−2 per year for sugar maple). Net Ca mineralization in the mineral soil was significantly larger beneath sugar maple (142mmolm−2 per year) than beneath the other tree species (ranging between −10mmolm−2 per year for beech and 55mmolm−2 per year for white ash). These results show that Ca mineralization rates are large and differ significantly among tree species, affecting the spatial pattern of soil acidity and Ca availability in a mixed-species forest stand.},

  abstract = {Biological, atmospheric, and geochemical processes interact to shape how element cycles and nutrient losses develop within newly formed landscapes. We examined losses of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and base cations across a four-million-year substrate age gradient of Hawaiian montane tropical forests, with the goal of understanding how losses depend on changes in biotic demand, weathering, and atmospheric sources. We were particularly interested in whether losses of nutrients that are not subject to traditional mechanisms of biotic availability could influence ecosystem fertility and nutrient limitation over time. Over a three-year period we sampled nutrient outputs in soil solutions below the active plant–soil system and small streams, gaseous N losses (NO, N2O, and N2), and pools and transformations of N in soils. Weathering was the major determinant of ecosystem losses of P, of base cations and Si, and of ecosystem acid–base status. Sharp reductions in weathering inputs after 20 000 years of forest development caused dramatically lower outputs of P (∼65\% reduction), Ca2+ (∼99\%), and Si (∼94\%), to rates that matched inputs from dilute sea-salt and dust aerosols. Internal production of organic acids, in combination with low weathering, caused highly acidic soil waters (pH {$<$} 5.0) with elevated Al (up to 300 μg/L) and Ca:Al ratios ({$<$}0.3) below values considered critical thresholds for many plant species. Long-term N and P interactions were more complex than predicted by the Walker and Syers model, with important influences of N and P loss pathways that were not subject to direct biotic availability. While losses of available forms of dissolved N and P, and N gases followed (as predicted) ecosystem nutrient availability, significant dissolved organic N (DON) and dissolved organic P (DOP) losses occurred independent of ecosystem N or P status. DON losses were not sufficient (relative to external inputs) to sustain N limitation beyond 20 000 years, while dissolved P losses remained large enough to maintain P limitation in older forests. Forests developed high N:P loss ratios over time ({$>$}300 on mass weight basis) due to efficient P recycling and unexpectedly high N throughputs (4–9 kg N·ha−1·yr−1) by either N fixation and/or N deposition.},

  abstract = {The PROFILE model is used extensively in the European Critical Loads programme as an aid to international negotiations on SO2 emission abatement. PROFILE calculates the rates of cation release by mineral weathering and it then uses these data to calculate soil solution and runoff chemistry. No independent assessment of the underlying assumptions and data in the model has been published and this paper reports such an assessment. The rate equations, which are the key to the PROFILE model require rate coefficients and constants. These have been derived from the literature but more work is required to produce a consistent set of constants. Manipulation of these rates to take into account the exposed reactive surface area of the minerals is fraught with problems. Calculation of exposed mineral surface area from soil textural data results in under-estimates and the requirement to determine the surface area fraction of the different minerals in the soil to be known is extremely difficult if not impossible. Further uncertainty is introduced by adjustment of the rates to take into account temperature differences and by the use of a default mineralogy which is compositionally unrealistic. Despite its flaws PROFILE usually predicts similar weathering rates to other methods of calculation. It is argued that the unrealistic constraints imposed by the use of the surface area equation may be responsible for limiting calculated weathering rate to a fixed range which coincides with characteristically determined values for weathering rates.},

  abstract = {The release of base cations by the weathering of soil minerals provides the primary buffer against the detrimental impact of acid deposition on the soil. The rate of release of base cations will be governed by mineral composition and the exposed surface area of mineral grains. In theory it is possible to calculate the surface area of a mixture of grains on the basis of particle size and geometry. An alternative is the use of correlations. It has been suggested (Sverdrup et al. 1990, Nordic Council of Ministers 98) that mineral surface area can be related to soil particle size distribution via a simple empirical equation. This contribution compares the surface areas of soils as calculated by geometric equations and Sverdrup's equation with actual BET measurements. The equations tested do not appear to be applicable to the soils used in the current work. Modified versions of the equation suggested by Sverdrup, applied to subsets of our data, based on sites and soil types, yield better results for the soils used in the current work. Statistically significant improved fits are obtained when soil mineralogy as well as soil texture is taken into account.},

Ecosystem-level estimates of Ca, Mg, and K pools and cycles in 50-year old Douglas-fir and red alder stands were used to determine the effect of overstory composition on net cation removal from the mineral soil, i.e. cation export from the soil in excess of additions. Net cation removal from Douglas-fir soil was 8 kg Ca ha−1 yr−1, 1 kg Mg ha−1 yr−1, and 0.3 kg K ha−1 yr−1. Annual cation export from soil by uptake and accumulation in live woody tissue and O horizon was of similar magnitude to leaching in soil solution. Atmospheric deposition partially off-set export by adding cations equivalent to 28–88\% of cation export. Net cation removal from red alder soil was 58 kg Ca ha−1 yr−1, 9 kg Mg ha−1 yr−1, and 11 kg K ha−1 yr−1. Annual cation accumulation in live woody tissue and O horizon was three times greater than in Douglas-fir, while cation leaching in soil solution was five to eight times greater. The lack of excessive depletion of exchangeable cations in the red alder soil suggests that mineral weathering, rather than exchangeable cations, was the source of most of the removed cations. Nitric acid generated during nitrification in red alder soil led to high rates of weathering and NO3-driven cation leaching.},

As required plant and microbial nutrients, N, P, and S are taken up by organisms, incorporated into organic matter, and released from the organic matter during decomposition. Therefore, the distribution and cycling of these nutrients can be closely related. However, the quantitative relationships between these elements in vegetation, as expressed by nutrient ratios (N:P and N:S), vary within trees and between biomes (Vitousek et al. 1988). Accumulation of organic matter and associated N and S in soil over long time periods can be strongly influenced by P dynamics (McGill and Christie 1983). Over shorter periods, stabilization and mineralization of organic N and P in soil are controlled by different factors; the control of organic S may be similar to N or P, depending on its chemical form (McGill and Cole 1981).},

  abstract = {Nitrogen (N) is a key nutrient that shapes cycles of other essential elements in forests, including calcium (Ca). When N availability exceeds ecosystem demands, excess N can stimulate Ca leaching and deplete Ca from soils. Over the long term, these processes may alter the proportion of available Ca that is derived from atmospheric deposition vs. bedrock weathering, which has fundamental consequences for ecosystem properties and nutrient supply. We evaluated how landscape variation in soil N, reflecting long-term legacies of biological N fixation, influenced plant and soil Ca availability and ecosystem Ca sources across 22 temperate forests in Oregon. We also examined interactions between soil N and bedrock Ca using soil N gradients on contrasting basaltic vs. sedimentary bedrock that differed 17-fold in underlying Ca content. We found that low-N forests on Ca-rich basaltic bedrock relied strongly on Ca from weathering, but that soil N enrichment depleted readily weatherable mineral Ca and shifted forest reliance toward atmospheric Ca. Forests on Ca-poor sedimentary bedrock relied more consistently on atmospheric Ca across all levels of soil N enrichment. The broad importance of atmospheric Ca was unexpected given active regional uplift and erosion that are thought to rejuvenate weathering supply of soil minerals. Despite different Ca sources to forests on basaltic vs. sedimentary bedrock, we observed consistent declines in plant and soil Ca availability with increasing N, regardless of the Ca content of underlying bedrock. Thus, traditional measures of Ca availability in foliage and soil exchangeable pools may poorly reflect long-term Ca sources that sustain soil fertility. We conclude that long-term soil N enrichment can deplete available Ca and cause forests to rely increasingly on Ca from atmospheric deposition, which may limit ecosystem Ca supply in an increasingly N-rich world.},

Here, we focus on the controls on canopy conductance (gc), E, GPP and water use efficiency (WUE) and the effect of interannual climate variability at the intermediate-aged stand (DF49) and then analyze the effects of stand age following clearcut harvesting on these characteristics. Daytime dry-foliage Priestley–Taylor α and gc at DF49 were 0.4–0.8 and 2–6mms−1, respectively, and were linearly correlated (R2=0.65). Low values of α and gc at DF49 as well at the other two stands suggested stomatal limitation to transpiration. Monthly E, however, showed strong positive linear correlations to monthly net radiation (R2=0.94), air temperature (R2=0.77), and daytime vapour pressure deficit (R2=0.76). During July–September, monthly E (mm) was linearly correlated to monthly mean soil water content (θ, m3m−3) in the 0–60cm layer (E=453θ−21, R2=0.69), and GPP was similarly affected. Annual E and GPP of DF49 for the period 1998–2007 varied from 370 to 430mm and from 1950 to 2390gCm−2, respectively. After clearcut harvesting, E dropped to about 70\% of that for DF49 while ecosystem evapotranspiration was fully recovered when stand age was ∼12 years. This contrasted to GPP, which varied hyperbolically with stand age. Monthly GPP showed a strong positive linear relationship with E irrespective of the stand age. While annual WUE of HDF00 and HDF88 varied with age from 0.5 to 4.1gCm−2kg−1 and from 2.8 to 4.4gCm−2kg−1, respectively, it was quite conservative at ∼5.3gCm−2kg−1 for DF49. N-fertilization had little first-year response on E and WUE. This study not only provides important results for a more detailed validation of process-based models but also helps in predicting the influences of climate change and forest management on water vapour and CO2 fluxes in Douglas-fir forests.},

The production of bicarbonate, one of the most common anions, is regulated by soil CO2 pressure and pH. The mobility of phosphate is most strongly affected by adsorption reactions. The mobility of nitrate is regulated almost solely by biological processes, whereas chloride is relatively uninvolved in either biological or inorganic chemical reactions. Sulfate is intermediate, being involved in both biological and inorganic chemical reactions. Knowing these properties of the major anions, it is possible to assess and to predict the effects of several diverse site manipulations on soil leaching rates. Case studies from a site in Washington State consistently demonstrate the importance of accounting for bicarbonate transformations following site manipulations. Although organic anions are frequently dominant in cold-region soil solutions, very little information on the complex factors affecting their mobilities is available. Further research into organic anion mobility and futher attention to bicarbonate mobility should add greatly to the body of knowledge on nutrient transport processes in forest soils.},

  abstract = {The cycles of base cations differ from those of N, P, and S in several important respects. Inorganically driven processes such as weathering, cation exchange, and soil leaching are often considerably more important in base cation cycles than in the cycles of N, P, and S, whereas organic processes such as heterotrophic immobilization and oxidation are typically less important (Figure 8.1). The fact that Ca, K, and Mg exist primarily as cations in solution whereas N, P, and S exist primarily as anions has major implications for the cycling of these nutrients and the effects of acid deposition upon these cycles. The introduction of H+, whether by atmospheric deposition or by internal processes, will directly impact the fluxes of Ca, K, and Mg via cation exchange or weathering processes. Thus, soil leaching is often of major importance in cation cycles, and many forest ecosystems show a net loss of base cations (in contrast to net gains of N and P; Cole and Rapp 1981).},

  abstract = {Soil and stream chemical responses to liming in a deciduous forest watershed at Coweeta, NC, are compared with simulation results using the Nutrient Cycling Model (NuCM). Field comparisons of limed and unlimed soils after 23 yr indicated substantial net retention of applied Ca2+ and Mg2+ in upper soil horizons, even in black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia L.) sites where NO−3 leaching was elevated. We hypothesized that NuCM simulations would also show that (i) retention of most applied Ca2+ and Mg2+ in the upper horizons and (ii) increased Ca2+ and Mg2+ retention with increased cation exchange capacity (CEC) and exchangeable H+ (simulating pH-dependent CEC). Both hypotheses were supported by simulation results for Ca2+, but not for Mg2+. Most applied Mg2+ in the simulations was retained in the BC horizon, where the largest pool of exchangeable Mg2+ was initially located. Increasing CEC and exchangeable H+ did result in increased retention of applied Ca2+ and Mg2+ in surface horizons. However, increasing CEC caused lower Mg2+ retention in the BC horizon, which offset the surface horizon increases and resulted in lower total retention of applied Mg2+. Simulated BC horizon soil solution concentrations mimicked the general patterns in streamwater NO−3, Mg2+, Na+, Cl−, SO2−4, and K+ between 1971 (12 yr after liming) and 1979. NuCM simulations did not, nor was it possible to simulate the observed effects of an insect outbreak on streamwater NO−3.},

  abstract = {Ecosystem analysis has established nutrient cycling as an important area of ecology involving biological, chemical, and geological interactions. Studying the flow of elements through ecosystems provides us with a tool for understanding the functioning of ecosystems. For example, if an ecosystem component has a rapid flux of elements through it, or if it stores large amounts of an element, that component is clearly important in ecosystem function. Nutrient cycling strongly influences ecosystem productivity since nutrient flows are closely linked with transfers of carbon and water. In addition nutrient cycling may also affect succession and evolution in forest ecosystems. Various distinct processes are involved in nutrient cycling, such as decomposition, weathering, uptake, leaching, and so on. Each is a precursor to another and the flow of nutrients follows a set of interconnected steps. Although the basic nutrient cycling processes are common to all ecosystems, the rates of the processes vary from one forest ecosystem to another. This variation plays an important role in forest succession and evolution. For example, long-term foliage retention by conifers may allow a species to exist where only a marginal nutrient supply is available from the soil. Nitrogen-fixing species, on the other hand, can occupy sites where nitrogen availability is low because they can provide their own nitrogen. An understanding of nutrient cycling is thus essential for the rational management of forest ecosystems. Nitrogen is recognized as the most limiting element for forest growth in the Pacific Northwest, particularly in Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) ecosystems (Gessel and Walker 1956; Gessel et al. 1969). For this reason this chapter focuses largely on nitrogen cycling. Cycling of other elements such as potassium and calcium are compared with that of nitrogen, where contrasting behavior may provide insight into nutrient-cycling processes. The objectives of this chapter are to (1) briefly describe the important nutrient cycling processes; (2) contrast nutrient cycles in different forest eco-},

The unsaturated transient flow method has been developed for determining adsorption isotherms for weakly reactive ions without causing excessive desorption of strongly adsorbed native ions. The objective of this study was to extend the method to determine NO3 − adsorption isotherms in an Andisol in the absence or presence of Cl competing for the adsorption sites Kannondai subsoil (Hydric Hapludand), premixed with a Ca(NO3)2 or CaCl2-Ca(NO3)2 solution at different concentrations, was packed into sectionable columns, and one-dimensional water absorption experiments were conducted. Anion adsorption by soil, Q n, and the liquid-phase concentration, C n, prior to the water imbibition were obtained from the plots of the anion content vs. water content in the region beyond the ‘plane of separation,’ where the antecedent solution was accumulated. The values of Qn and C n found in a series of column experiments were then used to construct the isotherms describing the solution composition-dependent adsorption of NO3 − and Cl−. e fitted to Langmuir-type equations, the maximum adsorption for NO3 − (Qmax= 27,1-29.0 mmolc kg−1) was consistently smaller than that for Cl− (Qmax = 455 46.1 mmolc kg−1), while the empirical constant K (= 0.0238 - 0.0274 m3 molc −1) was insensitive to the anion species.

  abstract = {Litterfall and its subsequent decomposition are important feedback mechanisms in the intrasystem cycling of nutrients in forest ecosystems. The amount of litterfall and the rate of decomposition are expected to vary with stand age and climate. Over a 2-year period, decomposition of five litter types were measured in two second-growth forest stands and one old-growth stand in the Cascade Mountains of southern Washington state, USA. Both second-growth stands were dominated by Douglas-fir [Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.,) Franco] but one had a significant proportion of red alder (Alnus rubra Bong.), a nitrogen (N) fixer. The old-growth stand was dominated by Douglas-fir and western hemlock [Tsuga heterophylla (Raf.) Sarg.]. All stands had a relatively shallow layer of forest floor mass. The five litter types were placed in each stand to evaluate decomposition patterns. Despite significant differences in stand age, microclimate and mean residence times for carbon (C) and N, the rates of litter mass loss varied only slightly between sites. The relative order of species litter mass loss was: vine maple {$>$} salal = western hemlock {$>$} Douglas-fir (from the youngest stand) {$>$} Douglas-fir (from the N rich stand with red alder). The initial litter lignin concentration, not lignin: N, was the primary determinant of decomposition rates, although the initial N concentration was the predictor for mass loss after 2 years in the N rich Douglasfir-alder stand. All litter types showed immobilization of N for nearly 2 years. Data for Douglas-fir litter suggest that higher levels of N may retard decomposition of tissues with greater amounts of lignified material. The retention of N by the litter appeared influenced by the nutrient capital of the stands as well as the forest floor C: N ratio. Decomposition was minimal during the cold winter months, but displayed a definitive peak period during early Fall with wet weather, warm soils, and fungal activity. Thus, longterm climatic change effects on forest floor C storage may depend more on changes in seasonally of precipitation changes than just temperature changes.},

  abstract = {Forest plantation is a widely used silvicultural practice throughout Europe most particularly to renew planted forest stands. The long term impact of forest plantations on soil fertility is a major concern for forest managers and policy makers, in particular in the context of global change because forests endure increased climatic and/or silvicultural and/or nutritional pressure. In the present study we investigated the tree species effects on soil solution chemistry and major elements fluxes, to better understand the impact of tree species on soil processes and fertility. The chemical composition of throughfall and soil solutions were compared between six 35-year-old monospecific stands (Norway spruce, Corsican pine, sessile oak, European beech, Douglas fir and Nordmann fir) and the reference plot (beech and oak coppice with standards) of the common garden experiment at the Breuil-Chenue Experimental site (Burgundy, France). Tree species had a strong effect on the chemistry of throughfall and soil solution, in particular on the relative contribution of nitrate, sulfate and dissolved organic carbon to the anionic charge. Mean concentrations of major elements varied widely between stands. Nitrate concentrations were highest for the Douglas fir and Corsican pine probably due to the tree species effect on nitrification processes. In both stands, the nitrate leaching causes large acidification with high drainage losses of magnesium, calcium and monomeric aluminum. For Norway spruce, sessile oak, European beech and reference plot, sulfate and dissolved organic carbon were the main anionic drivers for solution chemistry and nutrient fluxes. Soil acidification processes were less intense in these stands and aluminum was mainly transported in the soil profile by Al-cheluviation by dissolved organic compounds. The results of this study suggest that tree species strongly influence the chemistry of throughfall and soil solutions and may strongly influence on the short-term (35years) soil pedogenic processes from weak acidification and crypto-podzolisation to strong soil acidification.},

  abstract = {The pace and degree of nutrient limitation are among the most critical uncertainties in predicting terrestrial ecosystem responses to global change. In the northeastern United States, forest growth has recently declined along with decreased soil calcium (Ca) availability, suggesting that acid rain has depleted soil Ca to the point where it may be a limiting nutrient. However, it is unknown whether the past 60 y of changes in Ca availability are strictly anthropogenic or partly a natural consequence of long-term ecosystem development. Here, we report a high-resolution millennial-scale record of Ca and 16 other elements from the sediments of Mirror Lake, a 15-ha lake in the White Mountains of New Hampshire surrounded by northern hardwood forest. We found that sedimentary Ca concentrations had been declining steadily for 900 y before regional Euro-American settlement. This Ca decline was not a result of serial episodic disturbances but instead the gradual weathering of soils and soil Ca availability. As Ca availability was declining, nitrogen availability concurrently was increasing. These data indicate that nutrient availability on base-poor, parent materials is sensitive to acidifying processes on millennial timescales. Forest harvesting and acid rain in the postsettlement period mobilized significant amounts of Ca from watershed soils, but these effects were exacerbated by the long-term pattern. Shifting nutrient limitation can potentially occur within 10,000 y of ecosystem development, which alters our assessments of the speed and trajectory of nutrient limitation in forests, and could require reformulation of global models of forest productivity.},

  abstract = {A synthesis of the biogeochemistry of Ca was done during 1963-1992 in reference and human-manipulated forest ecosystems of the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (HBEF), NH. Results showed that there has been a marked decline in concentration and input of Ca in bulk precipitation, an overall decline in concentration and output of Ca in stream water, and marked depletion of Ca in soils of the HBEF since 1963. The decline in streamwater Ca was related strongly to a decline in SO\textsubscript{4}\textsuperscript{2-}+NO\textsubscript{3}\textsuperscript{-} in stream water during the period. The soil depletion of Ca was the result of leaching due to inputs of acid rain during the past 50 yr or so, to decreasing atmospheric inputs of Ca, and to changing amounts of net storage of Ca in biomass. As a result of the depletion of Ca, forest ecosystems at HBEF are much more sensitive to continuing inputs of strong acids in atmospheric deposition than expected based on long-term patterns of sulfur biogeochemistry. The Ca concentration and input in bulk precipitation ranged from a low of 1.0 μmol/l and 15 mol/ha-yr in 1986-87 to a high of 8.0 μmol/l and 77 mol/ha-yr in 1964-65, with a long-term mean of 2.74 μmol/l during 1963-92. Average total atmospheric deposition was 61 and 29 mol/ha-yr in 1964-69 and 1987-92, respectively. Dry deposition is difficult to measure, but was estimated to be about 20\% of total input in atmospheric deposition. Streamwater concentration reached a low of 21 μmol/l in 1991-92 and a high of 41 μmol/l in 1969-70, but outputs of Ca were lowest in 1964-65 (121 mol/ha-yr) and peaked in 1973-74 (475 mol/ha-yr). Gross outputs of Ca in stream water were positively and significantly related to streamflow, but the slope of this relation changed with time as Ca was depleted from the soil, and as the inputs of sulfate declined in both atmospheric deposition and stream water. Gross outputs of Ca in stream water consistently exceeded inputs in bulk precipitation. No seasonal pattern was observed for either bulk precipitation or streamwater concentrations of Ca. Net soil release varied from 390 to 230 mol/ha-yr during 1964-69 and 1987-92, respectively. Of this amount, weathering release of Ca, based on plagioclase composition of the soil, was estimated at about 50 mol/ha-yr. Net biomass storage of Ca decreased from 202 to 54 mol/ha-yr, and throughfall plus stemflow decreased from 220 to 110 mol/ha-yr in 1964-69 and 1987-92, respectively. These ecosystem response patterns were related to acidification and to decreases in net biomass accretion during the study. Calcium return to soil by fine root turnover was about 270 mol/ha-yr, with 190 mol/ha-yr returning to the forest floor and 80 mol/ha-yr to the mineral soil. A lower content of Ca was observed with increasing elevation for most of the components of the watershed-ecosystems at HBEF. Possibly as a result, mortality of sugar maple increased significantly during 1982 to 1992 at high elevations of the HBEF. Interactions between biotic and abiotic control mechanisms were evident through elevational differences in soil cation exchange capacity (the exchangeable Ca concentration in soils was significantly and directly related to the organic matter content of the soils), in soil/till depth, and in soil water and in streamwater concentrations at the HBEF, all of which tended to decrease with elevation. The exchangeable pool of Ca in the soil is about 6500 mol/ha, and its turnover time is quite rapid, about 3 yr. Nevertheless, the exchangeable pools of Ca at HBEF have been depleted markedly during the past 50 years or so, {$>$}21, 125 mol/ha during 1940-1995. The annual gross uptake of trees is about 26-30\% of the exchangeable pool in the soil. Some 7 to 8 times more Ca is cycled through trees than is lost in stream water each year, and resorption of Ca by trees is negligible at HBEF. Of the current inputs to the available nutrient compartment of the forest ecosystem, some 50\% was provided by net soil release, 24\% by leaching from the canopy, 20\% by root exudates and 6\% by atmospheric deposition. Clear cutting released large amounts of Ca to stream water, primarily because increased nitrification in the soil generated increased acidity and NO\textsubscript{3}\textsuperscript{-}, a mobile anion in drainage water; even larger amounts of Ca can be lost from the ecosystem in harvested timber products. The magnitude of Ca loss due to whole-tree harvest and acid rain leaching is comparable for forests similar to the HBEF, but losses from harvest must be superimposed on losses due to acid rain.},

  abstract = {Previous work has shown that tree turnover, tree biomass and large liana densities have increased in mature tropical forest plots in the late twentieth century. These results point to a concerted shift in forest ecological processes that may already be having significant impacts on terrestrial carbon stocks, fluxes and biodiversity. However, the findings have proved controversial, partly because a rather limited number of permanent plots have been monitored for rather short periods. The aim of this paper is to characterize regional–scale patterns of ‘tree turnover’ (the rate with which trees die and recruit into a population) by using improved datasets now available for Amazonia that span the past 25 years. Specifically, we assess whether concerted changes in turnover are occurring, and if so whether they are general throughout the Amazon or restricted to one region or environmental zone. In addition, we ask whether they are driven by changes in recruitment, mortality or both. We find that: (i) trees 10 cm or more in diameter recruit and die twice as fast on the richer soils of southern and western Amazonia than on the poorer soils of eastern and central Amazonia; (ii) turnover rates have increased throughout Amazonia over the past two decades; (iii) mortality and recruitment rates have both increased significantly in every region and environmental zone, with the exception of mortality in eastern Amazonia; (iv) recruitment rates have consistently exceeded mortality rates; (v) absolute increases in recruitment and mortality rates are greatest in western Amazonian sites; and (vi) mortality appears to be lagging recruitment at regional scales. These spatial patterns and temporal trends are not caused by obvious artefacts in the data or the analyses. The trends cannot be directly driven by a mortality driver (such as increased drought or fragmentation–related death) because the biomass in these forests has simultaneously increased. Our findings therefore indicate that long–acting and widespread environmental changes are stimulating the growth and productivity of Amazon forests.},

  abstract = {Soil microorganisms act as gatekeepers for soil–atmosphere carbon exchange by balancing the accumulation and release of soil organic matter. However, poor understanding of the mechanisms responsible hinders the development of effective land management strategies to enhance soil carbon storage. Here we empirically test the link between microbial ecophysiological traits and topsoil carbon content across geographically distributed soils and land use contrasts. We discovered distinct pH controls on microbial mechanisms of carbon accumulation. Land use intensification in low-pH soils that increased the pH above a threshold (\textasciitilde 6.2) leads to carbon loss through increased decomposition, following alleviation of acid retardation of microbial growth. However, loss of carbon with intensification in near-neutral pH soils was linked to decreased microbial biomass and reduced growth efficiency that was, in turn, related to trade-offs with stress alleviation and resource acquisition. Thus, less-intensive management practices in near-neutral pH soils have more potential for carbon storage through increased microbial growth efficiency, whereas in acidic soils, microbial growth is a bigger constraint on decomposition rates.},

  abstract = {A developing bioeconomy and the need for alternate sources of energy are promoting a more intensive procurement and use of forest biomass. While it is a fact that increased biomass harvesting generates greater nutrient losses from forest ecosystems relative to stem-only harvesting, the use of nutrient budget approaches as a decision support tool in managing forests under intensive biomass removal is uncommon. This lack of use can be explained by several factors including: large uncertainties in predicting certain fluxes, the poor representation of nutrient dynamics following harvest in nutrient cycling models, the lack of representation of biological feedback, the lack of appropriate validation, and finally the lack of maps of specific soil properties that would be required to predict nutrient budgets over forest landscapes. This review documents the impact of intensive biomass extraction on nutrient cycling and discusses the gaps in knowledge and the uncertainties associated with nutrient budgets. It identifies research and development issues that need to be resolved for making forest nutrient budgets more reliable and more useful to address the questions regarding the environmental sustainability of intensive biomass harvesting.},

  abstract = {Wide natural gradients of soil nitrogen (N) can be used to examine fundamental relationships between plant–soil–microbial N cycling and hydrologic N loss, and to test N-saturation theory as a general framework for understanding ecosystem N dynamics. We characterized plant production, N uptake and return in litterfall, soil gross and net N mineralization rates, and hydrologic N losses of nine Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) forests across a wide soil N gradient in the Oregon Coast Range (USA). Surface mineral soil N (0–10 cm) ranged nearly three-fold from 0.29\% to 0.78\% N, and in contrast to predictions of N-saturation theory, was linearly related to 10-fold variation in net N mineralization, from 8 to 82 kg N·ha−1·yr−1. Net N mineralization was unrelated to soil C:N, soil texture, precipitation, and temperature differences among sites. Net nitrification was negatively related to soil pH, and accounted for {$<$}20\% of net N mineralization at low-N sites, increasing to 85–100\% of net N mineralization at intermediate- and high-N sites. The ratio of net : gross N mineralization and nitrification increased along the gradient, indicating progressive saturation of microbial N demands at high soil N. Aboveground N uptake by plants increased asymptotically with net N mineralization to a peak of ∼35 kg N·ha−1·yr−1. Aboveground net primary production per unit net N mineralization varied inversely with soil N, suggesting progressive saturation of plant N demands at high soil N. Hydrologic N losses were dominated by dissolved organic N at low-N sites, with increased nitrate loss causing a shift to dominance by nitrate at high-N sites, particularly where net nitrification exceeded plant N demands. With the exception of N mineralization patterns, our results broadly support the application of the N-saturation model developed from studies of anthropogenic N deposition to understand N cycling and saturation of plant and microbial sinks along natural soil N gradients. This convergence of behavior in unpolluted and polluted forest N cycles suggests that where future reductions in deposition to polluted sites do occur, symptoms of N saturation are most likely to persist where soil N content remains elevated.},

Steep gradients ofincreasing 87Sr/86Sr in roots with soil depth were foundin all investigated profiles, which indicated that the flux of Sr deposited inrain and leached from the litter layer was tightly retained in the upper soillayers.

  abstract = {The transition state theory (TST), which is also known as theory of absolute reaction rates (ART) and the theory of activated state (complex), is essentially a refined version of crude collision theory, which treats the reacting molecules as the rigid spheres without any internal degree of freedom. The theory explains the rate of chemical reaction assuming a special type of chemical equilibrium (quasi-equilibrium) between the reactants and activated state (transition state complex). This special molecule decomposes to form the products of reaction. The rate of this reaction is then equal to the rate of decomposition of activated complex. This chapter also explains the limitation of TST theory and deals with the kinetics isotope effect.},

  abstract = {Maintaining, and if possible increasing, soil fertility is a major goal for sustainable forest management, because it determines to a large extent the site's capacity for wood production. As, generally, forest soils are poor, and the demand for wood is still increasing, the boundary of resilience of each ecosystem must be known. Several cases must be identified: the case of natural or native species forests, either planted or not, which are extensively managed and the case of intensively managed plantations. In this paper, input–output budgets are calculated according to temporal and spatial scales. The measurement of the main inputs and outputs is discussed. When all the fluxes entering and leaving the selected compartment are measured, the budget provides a realistic picture of the direction of change in soil fertility. In other cases, the validity of the budget has to be considered according to the proposed hypothesis. A balanced budget means that the element considered is not depleted from the soil. This does not mean that no changes occur in the ecosystem. A positive budget means that the element considered is accumulating in the system, which is not always favorable. A negative budget means the element considered is depleted in the system, but it has to be related to the available soil reserves and to the rate of flux into available pool to be a real index of risk for the ecosystem. Information from several case studies shows the interest of these budgets because (i) they are able to characterize depletion before the direct analysis of the system would be able to indicate it, and (ii) they give useful quantitative data for recommendations applicable to forest management. These budgets have the disadvantage of being labor-intensive and expensive. They are also site-specific and give little direct information for identifying the mechanisms of nutrient tranformations within the ecosystem. The relationships between forest production and nutrient availability are not sufficiently known to be able to quantify the variation in production when nutrient depletion is observed. On account of the difficulty in calculating such a budget, the most efficient strategy could be the following: (i) calculate budgets in a representative network of sites; (ii) relate the individual budgets to more easily available parameters; and (iii) propose more simple indicators for managers. Land classification and the potential impact of forest management is required for giving appropriate recommendations to managers.},

Interest in such cation distribution problems has been motivated by a need to improve fertilization to maintain well-balanced concentrations of soil exchangeable Ca, Mg, and K for optimum crop growth; to control potentially toxic Al with Ca and Mg additions in acidic agronomic soils; and to control excess Na with Ca amendments in irrigated soils. The effects of atmospheric deposition of pollutant sulfate on soils is a similar problem and should alter cation distributions between solutions and exchange sites in predictable ways. The consequences of sulfate deposition are potentially serious: displacement of greater concentrations of exchangeable Al, Ca, and Mg (polyvalent cations) into soil solutions, and long-term depletions of exchangeable nutrient cations, for example, Ca and Mg, in highly weathered soils with limited mineral weathering rates.},

  abstract = {The ability of soil to sustain its supply of nutrients to a growing forest is controlled by a complex of biogeochemical processes. Forest soil data are notably absent, however, that describe sustained nutrient supply of nutrient depletion. The objective of this study was to evaluate how exchangeable nutrient cations of a previously cultivated Ultisol responded to the first three decades of pine forest development. On six occasions during the three decades, the upper 0.6 m of soil was sampled from eight permanent plots and chemically analyzed with the same procedures. During this period, KCl-exchangeable acidity (as positive charges of adsorbed H and Al ions) increased by 37.3 kmol"c/ha in the upper 0.6 m of soil and positive charges of exchangeable Ca and Mg were depleted by 34.8 and 8.9 kmol"c/ha (by 696 and 108 kg/ha), whereas, exchangeable K was reduced by only 0.5 kmol"c/ha (19 kg/ha). Depletion of soil exchangeable Ca was on the same order of magnitude as Ca removals (i.e., Ca accumulation in biomass and forest floor plus that lost in soil leaching). Removals of soil Mg also appeared to outpace resupply from recycling, atmospheric deposition, and mineral weathering, but not the same degree as Ca. Over the three decades, soil leaching loss of these divalent cations (from 0.6 m depth) appeared equal to cation accumulation in biomass plus forest floor, with sulfate balancing about half these cations in leachates. In contrast to Ca and Mg, total K removals from the soil exceeded reductions in soil exchangeable K by nearly 20-fold. Exchangeable K was well buffered in surface mineral soils apparently due to a combination of biological recycling via leaching of canopies and forest floor plus mineral weathering release. These nutrient dynamics may be common to many nutrient-demanding forest ecosystems supported by soils with low activity kandic or oxic horizons. Such soils (Ultisols and Oxisols) occur on many hundreds of millions of hectares in temperate and tropical zones.},

  abstract = {Element dynamics (C, N, P, Ca, Mg, Mn, Fe, and Al) were examined along a decay continuum from freshly fallen litter to soil organic matter in a red spruce ecosystem in Maine. The continuum was defined using previously reported data on litterfall chemistry and the early stages (i.e., first 24 mo) of decay, combined with new studies on an additional 33 mo of decay and an evaluation of forest floor organic matter at the same site. Carbon concentrations decreased over time as fresh litter was transformed into soil organic matter; N, Fe, and Al concentrations increased; and P, Ca, Mg, and Mn concentrations showed variable patterns of increased and decrease. In general, homogeneity of the litter increased as fresh litter of different initial chemistries was transformed into chemically more uniform soil organic matter. Ecosystem budgets indicated that after 57 mo of decay, litter had lost 63\% of its original mass and had released C (65\%),N (17\%), P (79\%), Ca (50\%), Mg (80\%), and Mn (74\%), and had accumulated Al (431\%) and Fe (353\%). Evidence is presented indicating that the retention of Al (and Fe) is primarily controlled by abiotic adsorption onto litter exchanges sites. Overall results are consistent with a two—phase model of decay: in the first phase (0 to 3—4 yr), mass loss fits a negative exponential model of decay, an inverse linear relationship exists between N concentration and mass loss, and rapid changes are observed in litter chemistry; the second phase (3—4+ yr) is characterized by markedly slower changes in mass loss and litter chemistry.},

  abstract = {Information on primary production, decomposition, hydrology, and element cycling was integrated in annual budgets of accumulation and flux among components of a mature Douglas-fir forest ecosystem. Annual N input in precipitation and dust was 2.0 kg/ha, and an estimated 2.8 kg/ha were fixed by cyanophycophilous lichens in the canopy. Annual N loss to groundwater was 1.5 kg/ha. N appeared to be accumulating in the ecosystem. An annual decrease of \textasciitilde{} 2.8 kg/ha in vegetation was offset by estimated increases of 5.0 kg/ha in fallen logs, and 2.8 kg/ha in soil organic matter. Microparticulate litterfall provided a large input of N to the forest floor (3.3 kg@?ha\^-\^1@?yr\^-\^1). Annual input of metallic cations in precipitation was only 545 eq/ha, whereas weathering input (net release of cations to solution from primary and secondary minerals) was estimated by difference at @?9000 eq/ha. Total annual loss to groundwater was 9400 eq/ha and, because of little cation accumulation, loss almost exactly balanced input. Net transfers of P were small. Total annual input was 0.5 kg/ha, total loss was 0.7 kg/ha, and net accumulation was -0.2 kg/ha. Input of elements in precipitation and dryfall was small compared with that in the eastern United States. Water chemistry profiles showed that the biologically important elements N, P, and K increased in concentration as water passed through the canopy and litter layer but decreased as water passed through the rooted part of the mineral soil. In contrast, Na increased by a factor of 20 as water passed through the rooted soil. Concentrations of all elements except Mg were lower in the stream water than in solution at 2.0-m depth in the subsoil. At our site, unlike some eastern forests, Kjeldahl N (organic N plus NH"4\^+) accounted for most of the measured N in solution. Nitrate levels were low, averaging @{$<$}20 @mg/L NO"3\^--N at all points in the profile. Titratable alkalinity dominated anion chemistry in the mineral soil, but in the upper parts of the water chemistry profile (precipitation, throughfall, and litter leachate) Cl\^- and SO"4\^= together accounted for 30-40\% of the negative charge. Total return to the forest floor in litterfall was greater than that reported for other Douglas-fir stands mainly because of plentiful microparticulate forms and coarse woody debris. Leaf fall accounted for less than half of the total litterfall input of N to the forest floor. Element accumulations in coarse woody debris almost cancelled the negative net annual increments in the living vegetation compartments. Overall cycling patterns show that only the biologically limiting element, N, was tightly conserved. For other elements, losses nearly equaled or even exceeded inputs. Redistribution from old to new foliage was also more important for N, P, and K than for Ca, Mg, and Na. Solution transport processes were important for all elements and dominated the cycling patterns of biologically less important elements such as Ca and Na. Vegetation absorbed metallic cations mainly from the mineral soil. However, much N and P were absorbed by roots penetrating up to or into the litter layer. Fluxes of hydrogen ions (H\^+) resulting from water flow were negligible (@{$<$}10\^2 eq@?ha\^-\^1@?yr\^-\^1) compared with H\^+ release during carbonic acid dissociation and H\^+ removal accompanying cation release in weathering (both @?10\^4 eq@?ha\^-\^1@?yr\^-\^1). Uptake of metallic cations by vegetation and release during decomposition exceeded uptake and release of sulfur and phosphorus anions, resulting in a net H\^+ flux of @?3 x 10\^3 eq@?ha\^-\^1@?yr\^-\^1. An increase in acidity of the rainfall to pH 4.0 would increase H\^+ input only @?3 x 10\^2 eq@?ha\^-\^1@?yr\^-\^1.},

The data required for model application can be operationally determined on soil samples, making the model generally applicable and independent of any type of calibration. The model considers the contribution to the weathering rate from 12 groups of the most common primary and secondary minerals of soils, reacting in separate reactions with H+-ion, H2O, CO2 and organic acids expressed as dissolved organic carbon (DOC). The weathering rate sub-model couples the effects of dissolved Al and base cations on the reaction mechanisms. The model takes into account changes in soil temperature, different chemical conditions, the effect of vegetation interactions with the soil and N transformations. The kinetic coefficients and reaction orders are based on a complete re-evaluation of weathering data available in the literature, and additional kinetic data determined by the authors. Data from 23 different independent determinations of the field weathering rate from 15 sites in Scandinavia, Central Europe and North America were compiled and used to verify the model. The model is capable of estimating the release rate of base cations due to chemical weathering from information on soil mineralogy, texture and geochemical properties of the order of ±20\% of the rate determined by independent methods. The results indicate that small amounts of dark minerals like epidote and hornblende, and the plagioclase content, largely determine the field weathering rate.},

Thus it became the obvious parameter to use for tuning the models, since the real value was unknown. This is not true. New models such as SAFE and PROFILE have made possible modeling of weathering rates in the field from geochemical and geophysical properties. The weathering model in PROFILE is a reductionistic type of model, where the main mechanism is based on a set of parallel molecular mechanisms at the mineral surface. Rate coefficients in the models have been taken from laboratory studies. In field tests, the PROFILE model has performed well and is capable of predicting the weathering rate well within the range determined by other methods. PROFILE is operationally used for regional weathering rate mapping and is currently applied in 37 countries. Through feedback mechanisms in the model, the weathering rate can be used to affect biotic processes.},

  abstract = {The PROFILE model, now incorporated in the ForSAFE model can accurately reproduce the chemical and mineralogical evolution of the soil unsaturated zone. However, in deeper soil layers and in groundwater systems, it appears to overestimate weathering rates. This overestimation has been corrected by improving the kinetic expression describing mineral dissolution by adding or upgrading ‘breaking functions’. The base cation and aluminium brakes have been strengthened, and an additional silicate brake has been developed, improving the ability to describe mineral-water reactions in deeper soils. These brakes are developed from a molecular-level model of the dissolution mechanisms. Equations, parameters and constants describing mineral dissolution kinetics have now been obtained for 102 different minerals from 12 major structural groups, comprising all types of minerals encountered in most soils. The PROFILE and ForSAFE weathering sub-model was extended to cover two-dimensional catchments, both in the vertical and the horizontal direction, including the hydrology. Comparisons between this improved model and field observations is available in Erlandsson Lampa et al. (2019, This special issue). The results showed that the incorporation of a braking effect of silica concentrations was necessary and helps obtain more accurate descriptions of soil evolution rates at greater depths and within the saturated zone.},

  abstract = {We developed a process-oriented model called NutsFor that simulates nutrient cycling of major cations (Ca, Mg, K, Al, NH4, Na) and anions (NO3, SO4, Cl) and the stable isotope tracers for each of the respective elements at the scale of an ecosystem (isotopic fractionation are not simulated). We tested the ability of NutsFor to reproduce major element and stable isotope tracer (26Mg and 44Ca) cycling with the data from 35-yr old beech stand in France. NutsFor correctly reproduced the measured trends in soil solution chemistry for most major elements. The high similarity between modeled and measured distribution of 26Mg and 44Ca tracers in the ecosystem provided a unique and robust way to evaluate the hypotheses grounding the model and study the efficiency of Mg and Ca cycling at this very nutrient-poor site.},

  abstract = {Characterizing the nutrient cycles at the Integrated Forest Study (IFS) study sites required estimates of both nutrient inputs and nutrient outputs. To determine nutrient outputs, estimates of soil water flux had to be coupled with nutrient concentrations in soil lysimeters. However, only a few IFS sites had direct measures of soil water flux (e.g., gaged watersheds at Coweeta and Turkey Lakes), and even in these instances, water flux measurements were not directly comparable with water flux below the lowest lysimeter location. Thus, our purpose was to provide water flux estimates corresponding to lysimeter locations for the IFS sites. We used the hydrologic simulation model, PROSPER (Goldstein et al. 1974), to estimate evapotranspiration and soil water flux for several IFS study sites. A modeling approach was used because it was impractical to measure soil water flux at each site. While other hydrologic models were available (e.g., BROOK; Federer and Nash 1978), we chose PROSPER because it had been applied successfully in both hardwood and conifer forests at Coweeta (Swift et al. 1975; Huff and Swank 1985) and performed well in regional evapotranspiration assessments (USDA 1980).},

Many tools available today are either designed for planning periods that are too short to consider long-term sustainability, omit important parts of the forest ecosystem or are not capable of considering environmental changes. A long-term potential growth-limiting factor is the supply of available base cations as was demonstrated in an earlier study for a research area in southern Sweden. This paper presents the ForSAFE model, a computer implemented model system where four robust and well evaluated stand-alone models are combined to a dynamic model that considers vegetation and soil as well as the links between them. The system dynamics approach with causal loop diagrams (CLD) and feedback loop analysis (FLA) is presented as a useful tool for conceptualizing and constructing ecosystem models.},

  abstract = {Sources of variation in leaf area index (LAI; m2 of projected leaf area per m2 of ground area) and its seasonal dynamics are not well known in managed Douglas-fir stands, despite the importance of leaf area in forecasting forest growth, particularly in stands impacted by insects or disease. The influence of Swiss needle cast (SNC) on coastal Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii [Mirb] Franco) LAI and litterfall dynamics was quantified by destructively sampling 122 stems from 36 different permanent plots throughout north coastal Oregon, USA, and by monitoring litterfall for 3 years in 15 of these plots. LAI, total annual litterfall, and the seasonal distribution of foliage and fine woody litterfall were all influenced by stand structural attributes, physiographic features, and SNC severity. Mean LAI in this study was 5.44 ± 2.16. The relatively low LAIs were attributed primarily to the effects of SNC on foliage retention, and secondarily to its direct measurement by hierarchical foliage sampling in contrast to indirect measurement by light interception or tree allometry. For a given stand structure and SNC severity, LAI was 36\% greater in the fall after current year foliage was fully developed and older aged classes had not yet senesced. Annual litterfall expressed as a proportion of LAI at the start of the growing season varied from 0.13 to 0.53 and declined with increasing initial LAI. SNC also shifted more of the annual foliage litterfall to earlier in the spring. Fine woody litterfall experienced a different seasonal shift as the peak occurred later in the year on sites with high SNC, but this only occurred on northerly aspects. Defoliation from the endemic SNC pathogen can drastically reduce LAI and change both total and seasonal foliage litterfall patterns.},

  abstract = {The ForNBM was applied to the Nashwaak Experimental Watershed Project in central New Brunswick, Canada. The data represented a mixed hardwood site and included information about nutrient leaching, foliage and wood biomass, leaf fall, and ancillary information required for model initialization. Ancillary information included forest cover type, stand density, forest floor depth, soil rooting depth, soil texture, soil substrate type, initial amounts of biomass and N, S, Ca, Mg, and K content in foliage, wood, and roots, and mineral soil nutrient contents in soil solution, on ion-exchange sites, and in the soil. The authors were able to calibrate the model with existing data. The model simulated observed monthly leaching reasonably well. The r2-values of model simulations compared with field observations of monthly leaching of NO3−\_N, NH4+\_N, Ca, Mg, and K were 0.78, 0.7, 0.78, 0.84, and 0.75, respectively. Modeled multi-year cumulative leaching of NO3−\_N, NH4+\_N, Ca, Mg, and K compared with actual values gave r2-values close to one for all cases considered. The results also showed that soil nutrient leaching had increased approximately five-fold for NO3−\_N, 80\% for NH4+\_N, 71\% for K, 20\% for Ca, and 14\% for Mg during the 3 years following a stem-only harvest operation applied watershed-wide. However, the model simulation showed that increased nutrient leaching during the 11 years following the stem-only harvest was small compared with the amounts removed in the biomass during the harvest. Increased nutrient leaching following harvesting did not appear to impact site productivity over the long term.},
